Although SDN mitigates some security issues in cloud computing, new security issues related to its own architecture are also introduced. In this paper, we propose a quantum walks-based classification model which is available for intrusion detection in cloud computing. The proposed model concentrates feature information of data via Principal Component Analysis, and then aggregates the concentrated data in the way of quantum walks by a training-free clustering algorithm. The clustering algorithm constructs coin transformation and conditional shift transformation based on transition probabilities to move similar data toward each other. To enhance the usability of the proposed model in cloud computing security, we propose a new cloud architecture which adds security layer in SDN to ponder the protection of cloud computing fundamentally, and simplify transition probabilities equations of clustering algorithm without affecting clustering accuracy, decreasing the time complexity from O(nk2) to O(nk). The experimental results on popular datasets (Accuracy: 99.4% on InSDN, 95.8% on NSL-KDD, 98% on UNSW-NB15 and 96.4% on CSE-CIC-IDS2018) revealed that the proposed model is effective dealing with attacks on SDN-based cloud computing, and is able to maintain stable and excellent attack identification ability under different traffic intensities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Classification model; Cloud computing security; Clustering algorithm; Intrusion detection; Quantum walks; Software defined networking","Cloud security; Clustering algorithms; Computer architecture; Metadata; Principal component analysis; Software defined networking; Classification models; Cloud computing securities; Cloud-computing; Feature information; Intrusion-Detection; Principal-component analysis; Quantum walk; Security issues; Software-defined networkings; Transition probabilities; Intrusion detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164282421"

Since any assault or abnormality in the network can seriously disturb numerous realms like national security, private data storage, social welfare, economic issues, and so on. Consequently, one of the domains for detecting intrusion in the network is anomaly detection domain and it is a wide probe area. Various numerous methods and approaches have developed for anomaly detection. In the network security field, traffic anomaly detection has been a main aspect. The network security domain recognizes assaults in terms of significant deviations from the entrenched regular usage profiles. Nowadays, software-defined networking (SDN) is a new networking model has developed to ease effectual network control and management. This view investigates 50 probe papers focused on traffic flow rate prediction-based anomaly detection in SDN. Furthermore, it presents technique wise classifications like flow counting-based techniques, information theory-based approaches, entropy-based techniques, deep learning (DL)-based approaches, hybrid methods and network methods. An examination includes in an overview based on classification research techniques, toolset used, years of publication, datasets, and evaluation metrics for predicting anomaly in the SDN environment.

It has a centralized architecture that serves network management and demand fulfillment from a single point. Architecturally, SDN provides lofty benefits, but security measures are a severe concern that prevents universal adoption. If the SDN controller gets compromised, the intruders could ensign the route of network traffic based on their requirements which causes damage to the entire network. These security limitations of SDN get rectified by employing the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Deploying ML techniques for NIDS helps us to detect the anomalies within SDN. Selecting a minimal number of features is important as it decreases the computation overhead and accelerates the NIDS performances. For feature selection, a combination of k optimal features is selected using the hit-and-trial approach. As a result, it influences the system's durability for intrusion detection and pushes the model toward poor performance. In this study, we present a new hybrid framework for feature selection using Whale Optimisation Algorithm (WOA), Fisher Score (FS), and Information gain (IG), named Whale Optimization Algorithm-Fisher Feature Importance (WOA-F2I). WOA-F2I addresses the challenge of selecting the k number of an optimal subset of features. The evaluation result manifests the WOA-F2I feature selection technique that enhances the performance of the NIDS model, which backs the input for various classifiers- support vector machine, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and stochastic gradient descent. The proposed feature selection technique also provides better performance for binary class and multi-class attack detection. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dimension reduction; Feature selection; Fisher score; Information gain; Intrusion Detection System; Software Defined Networks; Whale Optimisation Algorithm","Biomimetics; Computer crime; Feature Selection; Gradient methods; Intrusion detection; Software defined networking; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Dimension reduction; Features selection; Fisher score; Information gain; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network intrusion detection systems; Optimization algorithms; Selection techniques; Software-defined networks; Whale optimization algorithm; Controllers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168796524"

It differs from traditional networks, which use switches and routers to control traffic. Using SDN, you can create and control virtual networks or traditional hardware networks. Furthermore, OpenFlow allows network administrators to control exact network behavior through centralized control of packet forwarding. For these reasons, SDN has advantages over certain security issues, unlike traditional networks. However, most of the existing vulnerabilities and security threats in the traditional network also impact the SDN network. This document presents the attacks targeting the SDN network and the solutions that protect against these attacks.

Therefore, adaptation of the current network security solutions to automated ones is more significant than ever to foster the development of the zero-touch networks and service management (ZSM) paradigm. Building on our preliminary work in this field, in this study, we provide a software-defined networking (SDN)-based framework that automates the detection and mitigation of slow-rate DDoS attacks. The framework uses deep learning (DL) to detect attacks and reinforcement learning (RL) to mitigate them. Furthermore, a network function virtualization (NFV)-assisted moving target defense (MTD) mechanism is included to amplify the effectiveness and flexibility of the solution. The framework is tested on a simulated network using open-source tools, namely Open Network Operating System (ONOS), Containernet, Apache Web Server, and Docker. The source code of a prototype of the framework is shared, which can be used and improved by interested researchers.

First, a hetero-integration Poly-Net (PN) loop delay analysis method is presented to clarify the system delays in CACC considering both inter- and intra-vehicle network influences. A mathematic equation is put forward to calculate the upper bound of the PN loop delays. Then, a collaborative software-defined network scheme is presented to deal with the PN loop delays, which consists of the application/strategy, network-control and network-data planes. In the network-control plane, a fraction-type basic period scheduling method is adopted. In the application/strategy plane, a delay-tolerant model predictive controller is designed for decision-making while a combination of an H∞ controller and a linear quadratic regulator is adopted for acceleration tracking control against local intra-vehicle network delays.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Information-Centric Networking (ICN) are complementary technologies for IoT services provisioning that reduce network traffic and service provisioning delays by caching content at intermediate nodes in the network. Existing research on Software-Defined Information-Centric Networking (SDICN) for IoT service provisioning suffers from two major challenges: (a) optimal caching node selection and (b) optimal path computation from content consumers to caching nodes based on end-to-end delay and link utilization constraints. We propose a SoftCaching framework that optimizes caching node selection for content publishers and computes the optimal routing path to caching nodes for content consumers. It computes optimal locations for caching nodes and finds optimal routing paths for IoT services to access cached content. SoftCaching analyzes network traffic on all nodes in the network and collects traffic metrics. It estimates the best possible caching nodes by using Waypoint Enforcement (WPE) and solving the traffic matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and QR Factorization. WPE and SVD-based QR factorization provide optimal locations to cache the content for IoT services. Subsequently, SoftCaching uses a constraint-based shortest path algorithm to compute the optimal routing path from content consumers to caching nodes. We make sure that the caching node and the routing path selection follow delay and link utilization constraints. We perform extensive experiments for evaluation, and the results show that SoftCaching outperforms state-of-the-art caching schemes in terms of delay, link load, hop count, path stretch, and energy consumption metrics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Caching; ICN; IoT; Routing path; SDN; Services provisioning; Waypoint enforcement","Energy utilization; Factorization; Quality of service; Singular value decomposition; Caching; Information-centric networkings; Network traffic; Node selection; Optimal routing; Routing path; Service provisioning; Software-defined networkings; Waypoint enforcement; Waypoints; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168544200"

Integration of software defined IoT (SDN-Enabled IoT) is considered an alternative solution for overcoming the specified problem through a single detection point using machine learning approaches. The controller has a resource limitation for implementing the classification process. Therefore, this paper extends the usage of Feature Importance to reduce the data complexity during the model generation process and choose an appropriate feature for generating an efficient classification model.

Existing multipath routing algorithms are still inadequate in terms of adapting to dynamic changes in the network state quickly and the cooperation of path selection and sub-flow assignment. Therefore, this paper proposes a sub-flow adaptive multipath routing algorithm for data centre networks (SAMP). The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is introduced. DDPG combines deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) to implement different network state changes quickly, especially in the process of topology, to achieve dynamic migration of the optimised decisions that have been learned. An adaptive multipath routing model for subflows is established to accomplish collaborative scheduling of path selection and subflow assignment based on the real-time state of the network.

Most of the existing firewalls, perimeter security, and middlebox solutions are built on static rules/signatures or simple rule matching, making them inflexible, susceptible to bugs, and difficult to introduce new services. This paper aims to improve network management in OpenStack Clouds by taking advantage of the combination of software-defined networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) and for making networks more predictable, reliable, and secure. Artificial intelligence is being used to monitor the behavior of the virtual machines and applications running in the OpenStack SDN cloud so that when any issues or degradations are noticed, the decision can be quickly made on how to handle that issue, being able to analyze data in motion, starting at the edge. The OpenStackDP framework comprises lightweight monitoring, anomaly-detecting intelligent sensors embedded in the data plane, a threat analytics engine based on ML/AI algorithms running inside switch hardware/network co-processor, and defensive actions deployed as virtual network functions (VNFs). This network data plane-based architecture makes high-speed threat detection and rapid response possible and enables a much higher degree of security. We have built the framework with advanced streaming analytics technologies, algorithms, and machine learning to draw knowledge from this data that is in motion before the malicious traffic goes to the tenant compute nodes or long-term data store. Cloud providers and users will benefit from improved Quality-of-Services (QoS) and faster recovery from cyber-attacks and compromised switches. The multi-phase collaborative anomaly detection scheme demonstrates an accuracy of 99.81%, average latencies of 0.27 ms, and response speed within 9 s.
