      "Performance Analysis of Between Software Defined Wireless Network and Mobile Ad Hoc Network Under DoS Attack\n",
      "-----\n",
      "The traditional network used today is unable to meet the increasing needs of technology in terms of management, scaling, and performance criteria. Major developments in information and communication technologies show that the traditional network structure is quite lacking in meeting the current requirements. In order to solve these problems, Software Defined Network (SDN) is capable of responding as it, is flexible, easier to manage and offers a new structure. Software Defined Networks have many advantages over traditional network structure. However, it also brings along many security threats due to its new architecture. For example, the DoS attack, which overloads the controller's processing and communication capacity in the SDN structure, is a significant threat. Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), which is one of the wireless network technologies, is different from SDN technology. MANET is exposed to various attacks such as DoS due to its security vulnerabilities. The aim of the study is to reveal the security problems in SDN structure presented with a new understanding. This is based on the currently used network structures such as MANET. The study consists of two parts. First, DoS attacks against the SDN controller were performed. Different SDN controllers were used for more accurate results. Second, MANET was established and DoS attacks against this network were performed. Different MANET routing protocols were used for more accurate results. According to the scenario, attacks were performed and the performance values of the networks were tested. The reason for using two different networks in this study is to compare the performance values of these networks at the time of attack. According to the test results, both networks were adversely affected by the attacks. It was observed that network performance decreased in MANET structure but there was no network interruption. The SDN controller becomes dysfunctional and collapses as a result of the attack. While the innovations offered by the SDN structure are expected to provide solutions to many problems in traditional networks, there are still many vulnerabilities for network security.\n",

      "The software defined network (SDN) is a new approach to building telecommunication networks, which can significantly increase the efficiency of telecommunication equipment and the entire network as a result of network functions virtualization (NFV). Removing separate functionality from network elements and its addition to a controller that manages a software defined network makes the it independent of equipment manufacturers. In this case, the problem of assessing the reliability of a software defined network, and in particular of a controller, becomes more important and valuable. An increase in the volume of software and its complication contributes to an increase in the number of errors at the stage of software development and leads to serious economic and reputational damage to the network service providers. Software reliability assessment deserves special attention, since it has significant differences from hardware reliability assessment. The paper discusses the main differences between software and hardware failures and examples of faults that can lead to SDN/NFV controller failure. An analytical model of the SDN/NFV controller operation in the conditions of software failures is presented. Two cases of failures are considered: with one critical state and with three critical states with different levels of failures criticality. Depending on these, the reliability indicators of the controller are determined: the availability factor and the unavailability factor. The model is based on the matrix method of describing the functioning of long-term use systems.\n",

      "Deficiency of flexibility and programmability of legacy network architecture has been the concern of many networking admirers for some years. Software defined networking (SDN) is a new emerging concept to logically centralize the network control plane in order to automate the configuration of individual network elements. However, the failures of SDN controller are every large impact on the network performance and availability. There are different failure modes in SDN controller outages such as hardware and software. Unplanned downtime is mostly caused by software failure due to software aging rather than hardware failure. The aging related faults have a huge effect on the availability for software components, SDN controllers. For that reason, the work presented in this paper offers the availability model for software aging of SDN controllers by applying software rejuvenation. A stochastic reward net (SRN) is proposed to evaluate the availability assessment of a cluster of SDN controllers. And then how software rejuvenation can improve the performance of SDN controllers is studied. To evaluate the availability of proposed model, mathematical analysis is performed.\n",

      "Conventional static networks have begun to be replaced with dynamic systems that are programmable. Software-Defined Network (SDN) is one example of the development of dynamic networks that are programmable with a new paradigm to provide convenience to users in designing, building, and managing computer networks. A software-defined network provides a centralized network distribution to facilitate network services to be more efficient. In SDN, the controller holds control of the control plane of the device while the data plane is distributed through the OpenFlow Switch. A centralized control plane on the controller can cause overhead when the number of users increasing in the network. Overhead on the controller results in service interruptions or even the controller fails to provide services on the net. The availability of a controller is essential to guarantee the availability of network services. High availability on the controller is achieved through the cluster controller. This paper discusses the performance of networks that implement high availability solutions on SDN. As a comparison in the experiment comparing the performance of using a cluster-controller with a multi-controller. The results are based on QoS parameters, and the average CPU load performance of the cluster controller is better than using a multi-controller.\n",

This review deals with the idea of distributed controllers in large scale software defined networking (LSSDN). Numerous studies have been available considering single controller based classical network. A single controller is insufficient to control the entire network, so a distributed controller or multi-controller is needed for easy flow processing. The details about single controller based SDN are published in the previous literature. So here, author’s only focuses on multi controller based software defined network which provides several advantages over classical network in form of features, configuration, performance and innovation. Furthermore, 6 recent distributed controllers are considered and compared on the basis of 26 different criteria’s. Also the placement problem in distributed SDN controller is explored.

      "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) dissociates the control plane from the data plane, creating a central point facilitating managed services and network virtualization. SDN allows flexibility by dynamic programmability features. On the other hand, Moving Target Defense (MTD) increases complexity in the network to prevent or delay attacks by continuously creating and adapting to the dynamic environment. In this paper, we implement a Moving Target Defense technique in Software-Defined Networking and analyze the TCP and UDP traffic generated in the network. MTD implementation in SDN has been well studied, but there is little work to analyze and evaluate the impact of this dynamic environment on SDN performance. The network's dynamic nature creates considerable overhead on the controller, resulting in poor performance, latency, jitter, and packet loss. This paper analyzes MTD traffic implemented in a software-defined network and compares the results with the traditional (without MTD) software-defined network topology.\n",

      "Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which plays a significantly important role in smart future cities, has become current hot research topics. However, the high heterogeneous nature of IoV has brought many new challenges such as low network performance and difficult network management for IoV. Software-defined networking enables the efficient solution of these problem. This article studies the measurement and analysis technology for software-defined networking of IoV. A new software-defined networking-based IoV heterogeneous networking measurement framework is proposed to build software-defined networking of IoV. We propose a performance measurement and analysis method to measure and characterize its performance. The performance indexes and measure methods about the delay, loss, throughput, delay jitter is in detail derived. The switch selection mechanism is proposed to establish optimal measurement points of advantage. The packet sampling process is presented to quickly obtain the needed measurement information from massive traffic flows. To validate our measurement method and fairly characterize its measurement performance for different controllers, we conduct massive simulation experiments to systematically analyze and compare current famous controllers. In such a case, we provide more comprehensive, systematic measurement analysis for application in software-defined networking of IoV. Experiments results show that our measurement approach is feasible and effective.\n",

      "Internet of Things (IoT) devices are resource and energy-constrained which forward many limitations such as packet loss, minimum storage capacity, lower computational ability, scalability, and availability. By introducing the concept of Software-Defined Network (SDN) in IoT, a new variant namely SDN-based IoT has been designed. The traditional SDN-based IoT system uses a single centralized controller to manage the network. The use of a single controller can be convenient, however, it gives rise to issues such as single point of failure (SPoF). To overcome these limitations, we have proposed an Edge-enabled Software-Defined Network architecture namely ESDoT. The edge-enabled SDN in ESDoT can provide swift response to the data that require instant focus. The SDN controllers installed in the edge network can help to reduce the computation, communication, and management ability. In the ESDoT architecture, multiple SDN controllers consequently improve the scalability and availability feature by keeping the required services and flow rules at the edge. The ESDoT architecture has been evaluated using a testbed setup. The experimental results were compared with Conventional SDN-based IoT (CSDN) and Random Selection of Computational path for SDN-based IoT mode (RSCM). It was observed that ESDoT architecture can reduce the average Round Trip Time (RTT) of the network by 18% and packet loss by 82%. The proposed architecture succeeded in reducing the end-to-end delay by 20% while increasing the system throughput by 32% when compared to the CSDN and RSCM.\n",

      "A software-defined vehicular network is made up of an IoT (Internet of Things) based vehicular ad-hoc network and a software-defined network. For better communication in IoT based vehicle networks, researchers are now working on the VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Network) to increase the overall system performance. To maximize the VANET ad-hoc network’s information application performance and reliability, edge computing has gained the attention of researchers. In current research, cloud computing is used for message related task execution, which increases the response time. We propose a Software-defined Fault Tolerance and QoS-Aware (Quality of Service) IoT-Based Vehicular Networks Using Edge Computing Secured by Blockchain to reduce overall communication delay, message failure fault tolerance, and secure service provisioning for VANET ad-hoc networks in this article. We proposed heuristic algorithms to solve the above mentioned problems of response delay, message failure, fault tolerance, and security provided by the Blockchain. The proposed model gets vehicle messages through SDN (Software defined network) nodes, which are placed on nearby edge servers, and the edge servers are validated by the blockchain to provide secure services to vehicles. The SDN controller, which exists on an edge server, which is placed on the road side to overcome communication delays, receives different messages from the vehicles and divides these messages in to two different categories. The message division is performed by the edge server by judging the time line, size, and emergency situation. SDN controller organized these messages and forwarded them to their destination. After the message is delivered to its destination, a fault tolerance mechanism checks their acknowledgements. If the message delivery fails, the fault tolerance algorithm will resend the failure message. The proposed model is implemented using a custom simulator and compared with the latest VANET based QoS and fault tolerance models. The result shows the performance of the proposed model, which decreased the overall message communication delay by 55% of the normal and emergency messages by using the edge server SDN controller. Furthermore, the proposed model reduces the execution time, security risk, and message failure ratio by using the edge server, cloud server and blockchain infrastructure.\n",

      "Next-generation edge nodes interfacing innovative IT clusters, 5G fronthaul, and internet of things (IoT) gateways to the optical metro/core network will require advanced and dynamic online quality of service (QoS) per-flow traffic treatment, assuring ultra-low latency requirements. However, current software-defined networking (SDN) implementations (e.g., OpenFlow) do not support forwarding procedures based on the network state, profile variations, and the history of flow statistics at the node level. Currently, such procedures require intervention by the SDN controller, leading to scalability issues and additional latency in data plane forwarding. Moreover, severe security challenges are expected to affect such nodes and threaten IT resources. Thus, increasing bandwidths will require direct deep packet inspection to avoid involvement of the SDN controller, as performed currently, or dedicated and costly security systems. This paper leverages on the potential of the programming protocol-independent packet processors (P4) open source language, recently introduced by the inventors of OpenFlow, to program the data plane structure and behavior of an SDN switch. P4 is able to instantiate custom pipelines and stateful objects, enabling complex workflows, user-defined protocols/headers, and finite state machines enforcement. Moreover, P4 allows portable implementations over different hardware targets, thus opening the way to open source fully programmable devices. Special effort is dedicated to motivate and apply P4 within a multilayer edge scenario, proposing the architecture and the applicability of an SDN P4-enabled packet-over-optical node. Moreover, three specific multilayer use cases covering dynamic traffic engineering (TE) (e.g., traffic offload and optical bypass) and cybersecurity (e.g., distributed denial of service port scan) are discussed and addressed through P4-based solutions. Experimental evaluations have been conducted over a multilayer SDN network exploiting reference P4 software switches (i.e., the behavioral model version 2, or BMV2) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) at 10 gigabit Ethernet optical interfaces. Extensive results report effective dynamic TE and cybersecurity mitigation enforcement at P4 switches without any controller intervention, showing excellent scalability performance and overall latencies practically in line with current commercial OpenFlow switches.\n",

      "-----\n",
      "SDN network hypervisors realize the virtualization of software-defined networks. They intercept the control path between tenant controllers and their respective virtual Software-Defined Networks (SDN). Over-utilizing SDN hypervisor resources (i.e., CPU) can degrade the control plane performance of the tenants. Although many hypervisor proposals exists, a detailed performance modeling of SDN hypervisors is missing in literature. A precise modeling of the required SDN hypervisor resources, however, is crucial for predictable and reliable operation of virtual software-defined networks. In this paper, we measure and evaluate how topology abstraction can affect the SDN hypervisor CPU utilization. We consider two topology abstraction cases: the (1) transparent and (2) big-switch abstraction. Our measurements taken from a real testbed indicate that the big-switch abstraction can reduce the SDN hypervisor CPU utilization up to $\\sim 4\\times $. Further, we evaluate different functions to model the SDN hypervisor CPU utilization based on our measurement results. Our evaluations show that a polynomial function provides the lowest fitting error. Motivated by our measurements, we conduct a first-step investigation of the impacts of topology abstraction on the Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem. Our initial simulation-based evaluations indicate that different topology abstraction procedures impact the results of the VNE problem.\n",

      "Software-defined networking (SDN) is a network technology that explicitly demarcates network control tasks from forwarding tasks. The infrastructure and the control plane are separated. It centrally specifies the control logic and manages the whole network. The network is controlled by a software program called a controller. A single controller is not sufficient to deal with the problem of scalability and dependability. To solve these problems, more number of controllers are required. Placing various controllers is called controller placement problem (CPP) in SDN. The problem is to select the count and location of controllers to be placed in the network. Control latency is an important metric in SDN as all functions are carried out through frequent message exchanges between the switches and controllers. Latency comprises mainly the processing, queuing, propagation and transmission latency. In a wide area network, propagation latency is an important metric which includes the average and worst case node to controller propagation latency. Besides, inter controller latency plays a significant role to maintain consistency in large networks. The sum total of switch-to-controller and inter-controller delay is known as the global latency. The objective of this paper is to improve SDN performance by lowering the network's overall latency in an optimal manner. A comparison of optimal with the random approach is shown in the results. Finding controller number while minimizing latency is another objective of this paper.\n",

An important one is the weaknesses related to the OpenFlow channel between network devices and controller, as the network can be attacked via the OpenFlow channel and exploit communications with the control plane. Our work proposes a solution to provide adequate security for OpenFlow messages in software-defined networks by using a hybrid key consisting of classical and quantum key distribution protocols to provide double security depending on the quantum's computational complexity and physical properties. To achieve this goal, the hybrid key is used with transport layer security protocol to provide confidentiality, integrity and quantum authentication to secure software-defined network connections between the control and data planes. We experimentally based on the SDN-testbed to show the workflow of exchanging quantum and classical keys between the control plane and network devices in the data plane, and our results showed the effectiveness of the hybrid key to enhance the security of the transport layer security protocol. Thereby achieving adequate security for controller communications with the data plane against classical and quantum computer attacks by conducting security analysis and clarifying the efficiency of the proposal in terms of the average required time.\n",

      "Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) expect assurances of timely delivery of data even during the occurrence of distinct faults. It is a challenge to manage the required bandwidth by providing resilience to link failures and dynamically changing bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we address the aforementioned challenge by exploring Software-Defined Networks (SDN). We present a framework coined SDN-RMbw (Software-Defined Networking Resilience Management for Bandwidth), which is a contract-based framework, where the components are bound to bandwidth contracts and a resilience manager. The bandwidth contracts state the bandwidth requirements of traffic flows. With each such contract, a monitor is associated, which is responsible to detect two events, run-time changes and link failures. Directly after receiving the event trigger reports from the monitor, new routes are calculated by a path-finding algorithm. Based on newly calculated routes, an observer detects whether the contract requirements are still satisfied, or the contract gets violated (termed as fault). To provide resilience to such faults in the network, a resilience manager integrated with control logic decides and executes a suitable response strategy. The proposed SDN-based framework aims at providing fault-resilience as well as adapting to different network-state changes. The proposed framework is evaluated using a Ryu SDN controller on a hardware testbed. Our results show that the proposed framework provides enhanced network resilience as compared to baseline mechanisms and improves the success rate up to 21% and bandwidth up to 111 Mbps under distinct network scenarios. Furthermore, extensive experimental emulations on the Mininet tool depicts the scalability of the proposed framework.\n",

Security requirements need to overlay and permeate through the different layers of 5G systems (physical, network, and application) as well as different parts of an E2E 5G architecture within a risk-management framework that takes into account the evolving security-threats landscape. 5G presents a typical use-case of wireless communication and computer networking convergence, where 5G fundamental building blocks include components such as Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and the edge cloud. This convergence extends many of the security challenges and opportunities applicable to SDN/NFV and cloud to 5G networks. Thus, 5G security needs to consider additional security requirements (compared to previous generations) such as SDN controller security, hypervisor security, orchestrator security, cloud security, edge security, etc. At the same time, 5G networks offer security improvement opportunities that should be considered. Here, 5G architectural flexibility, programmability and complexity can be harnessed to improve resilience and reliability.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Distribution Decision Mechanism (DDM) based on switch migration in the multiple subdomains SDN network. Firstly, through collecting network information, it constructs distributed migration decision fields based on the controller load condition. Then we choose the migrating switches according to the selection probability, and the target controllers are determined by integrating three network costs, including data collection, switch migration and controller state synchronization. Finally, we set the migrating countdown to achieve the ordered switch migration. Through verifying several evaluation indexes, results show that the proposed mechanism can achieve controller load balancing with better performance.\n",

There is the network situation that it may have multiple target destinations of the next network to the moving vehicle, which is called as Mobile Node (MN), can handover in vehicular networks. Therefore, it requires to make a suitable handover decision based on both the networking loading and MN's received signal strength. Although there are several studies applying Software Defined Network (SDN) to DMM for improving the performance of existed DMM-based schemes, the current network-based handover approaches still endure the high handover latency and high signaling cost. In this paper, a Load-Considered Handover Control Scheme for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) using Software Defined Network (SDN) over the vehicular environment, which is called as LC-SDN-DMM, that can support the handover decision and let MN be able to complete the handover preparation before MN disconnecting from the currently serving Mobility Anchor and Access Router (MAAR) to the next suitable MAAR, was proposed. LC-SDN-DMM also can support selecting the suitable next anchor router through the assistance of the SDN Controller. The simulation analysis has proved that the proposed LC-SDN-DMM approach has better handover performance than the conventional DMM approach regarding to throughput, handover delay and packets loss.\n",

      "Since the advent of the Software Defined Networking (SDN) in 2011 and formation of Open Networking Foundation (ONF), SDN inspired projects have emerged in various fields of computer networks. Almost all the networking organizations are working on their products to be supported by SDN concept e.g. openflow. SDN has provided a great flexibility and agility in the networks by application specific control functions with centralized controller, but it does not provide security guarantees for security vulnerabilities inside applications, data plane and controller platform. As SDN can also use third party applications, an infected application can be distributed in the network and SDN based systems may be easily collapsed. In this paper, a security threats assessment model has been presented which highlights the critical areas with security requirements in SDN. Based on threat assessment model a proposed Security Threats Assessment and Diagnostic System (STADS) is presented for establishing a reliable SDN framework. The proposed STADS detects and diagnose various threats based on specified policy mechanism when different components of SDN communicate with controller to fulfil network requirements. Mininet network emulator with Ryu controller has been used for implementation and analysis.\n",

The separation of control plane and data plane in its network architecture makes the network devices easier to configure because of the centralized control system using the SDN controller. Research about SDN then evolved towards the wireless networks, and Software-defined Wireless Networking (SDWN) began to be researched. In this paper, we present a performance evaluation of SDN-based wireless network. Using 802.11g wireless standard, we simulated some scenarios through Mininet-WiFi and we examined the impact of background traffic while doing the scenarios. The result shows that the performance of the SDN-based wireless network with VoIP scenarios decrease compared to no background traffic given, with the increase of delay by 60.73%, the increase of jitter by 20.62%, the increase of packet loss by 0.03%, and the decrease of throughput by 31.44 when the given background traffics are 1 Mbps, 100 kbps, 40 Mbps, and 50 Mbps. The performance with the file transfer scenarios also decreases compared to no background traffic, with the increase of delay by 459.05%, the increase of packet loss by 0.043%, the decrease of throughput by 64.64% when the given background traffic is 24.09 Mbps. The SDN-based wireless network performance with the video streaming scenarios decrease compared to no background traffic, with the increase of delay by 175.88%, the increase of jitter by 45100.12%, the increase of packet loss by 0.58%, and the decrease of throughput by 46.35% when the given background traffic is 40 Mbps.\n",

      "Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging network architecture that separates the control plane from the data plane of the network, enabling better control and management of network traffic while providing powerful centralized management capabilities and scalability. However, the centralized control model and flexibility of SDN also provides opportunities for low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS) attacks.First, SDN networks are vulnerable to LDoS attacks. If a low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS) attack occurs in an SDN network, the performance and availability of the entire network will be severely impacted.Second, SDN can enhance the effectiveness of LDoS attacks, and attackers can use SDN controllers to route attack traffic to specific parts of the target system, making the attacks more targeted. LDoS attack is a type of attack that intermittently sends short bursts of high-frequency packets to consume resources of the target system, aiming to degrade the quality of network services. Due to the periodic and intermittent nature of LDoS attacks, traditional distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) detection mechanisms have difficulty detecting them, resulting in high false alarm and missed alarm rates. This paper presents an online real-time detection (ORTD) attack system, which is deployed on SDN controllers and follows OpenFlow policies. The ORTD system consists of two modules: a coarse detection module and a CatBoost detection module. The two-level detection module combines port flow characteristics-based and CatBoost flow classifier based on OpenFlow flow table statistics to accurately detect LDoS attacks. Experimental results of the ORTD system show that it not only has a superior detection rate compared to traditional LDoS detection systems, but also reduces false alarm rates and missed detection rates.\n",

Moreover, there is a great rapid growth in mobile communication, Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, and Internet of Things (IoT) communications. All of these constitute burdens on legacy networks for managing heterogeneous network devices and elements. Software Defined Network (SDN) has been introduced to overcome legacy network limitations such as scalability and compatibility. SDN decouples the control and data planes; and moves all control logics from network devices to a separate layer where all the intelligence of the network is located, which is called controller. SDN controller plays as an orchestrator to manage these different networks technologies and to cope with the continuous increase of network devices. In this paper, the performance of two types of SDN controller is studied in different situations by examining the connectivity of a mobile wireless station with a fixed wired station during the motion through cellular network. The network convergence time, connectivity, available bandwidth, delay, and jitter of the moving station as well as the packet loss during handover are collected via simulation. Different scenarios using Pox and Floodlight SDN controllers on different cellular network conditions are emulated by Mininet WiFi emulator. The scenarios covered different number of wireless stations distributed across the network model. The results show an average 0f 18% packet loss ration improvement and almost half of the jitter by using Floodlight compared to POX while POX showed much less Convergence Time.\n",

      "Software-defined networking decouples control and data plane in softwarized networks. This allows for centralized management of the network. However, complete centralization of the controller’s functions raises the issue of the central point of failure, latency, and scalability. Distributed controller deployment is adopted to optimize scalability and latency problems. However, the existing controllers are monolithic, resulting in code inefficiency for distributed deployment. Recently, microservicesbased SDN solutions have been started and deployed as virtual network functions, enabling flexible deployment. Nonetheless, the softwarization of network functionalities introduces network I/O performance degradation both considering deployments based on virtual machines and containers. This paper first introduces a microservices-based SDN solution based on Ryu SDN Framework. Then investigates whether running Ryu’s network functionalities in a softwarized environment (e.g., virtual machine and container) would have a significant network I/O performance degradation. In particular, this work examines more in deep the Docker Container technology and analyzes its network setups. Multiple measurements were performed locally in a single machine. Our results show a comparison between microservicesbased non-virtualized SDN Controller and the virtualized one, and moreover, show a comparison between different Docker Container network setups.\n",

      "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has recently emerged as a result of the increased demand to access contents regardless of their location in the network services. This new approach facilitates content distribution as a service of the network with lower delay and higher security in comparison with the current IP network. Applying ICN in current IP infrastructure leads to major complexities. One approach to deploy ICN with less complexity is to integrate ICN with Software Defined Networking (SDN). The SDN controller manages the content distribution, caching, and routing based on the users' requests. In this paper, we extend these context by addressing the ICN topology management problem over the SDN network to achieve an improved user experience as well as network performance. In particular, a centralized controller is designed to construct and manage the ICN overlay. Experimental results indicate that this adopted topology management strategy achieves high performance, in terms of low failure in interest satisfaction and reduced download time compared to a plain ICN.\n",

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture in SAGIN has become a promising solution to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS). However, the current routing algorithms mainly focus on the QoS of the service, rarely considering the security requirement of flow. To realize the secure transmission of flows in SAGIN, we propose an intelligent flow forwarding scheme with endogenous security based on Mimic Defense (ESMD-Flow). In this scheme, SDN controller will evaluate the reliability of nodes and links, isolate malicious nodes based on the reliability evaluation value, and adapt multipath routing strategy to ensure that flows are always forwarded along the most reliable multiple paths. In addition, in order to meet the security requirement of flows, we introduce the programming data plane to design a multiprotocol forwarding strategy for realizing the multiprotocol dynamic forwarding of flows. ESMD-Flow can reduce the network attack surface and improve the secure transmission capability of flows by implementing multipath routing and multi-protocol hybrid forwarding mechanism. The extensive simulations demonstrate that ESMD-Flow can significantly improve the average path reliability for routing and increase the difficulty of network eavesdropping while improving the network throughput and reducing the average packet delay.\n",

      "With new data hungry application flooding the air traffic management (ATM) world, driven by system-wide information management (SWIM), advanced aeronautical information management (AIM) data exchange, and the latest remote virtual tower (RVT) video applications, the ATM industry is looking at modern, safe, and secure network technologies such as Software Defined Networks (SDN). Just a few years ago, only forward-leaning organizations embraced this compelling new concept to programmatically control their network resources.Today, SDN is acknowledged as a major building block of next generation ATM networks. The SDN concept separates the routing decisions, the `control plane', from the actual data forwarding hardware, the `data plane'. In SDN the routing decisions are performed in a separate SDN controller. Depending on the network architecture, SDN controllers can be deployed in a distributed or centralized fashion.In the distributed approach, SDN controllers are deployed at various key locations within the network, each responsible for a sub-set of network devices with no communication to other SDN controllers. Although this concept allows for lean deployments at each site it may lead to unstable and/or asymmetric routing because of sub-optimal routing decisions by each individual controller due to the lack of information of the complete network.To overcome this, in the centralized approach, clusters of synchronized SDN controllers are deployed at central locations within the network, each being able to take over the whole set of network devices. This allows for end-to-end optimized routing decisions as each cluster has all the network information available and the cluster members operate upon a synchronized information base.A fault case analysis shows that the centralized approach may fail if the network becomes partitioned. Partitioning occurs if the SDN cluster loses connectivity to a portion of the network. These network elements are then considered orphaned. To ensure continuity of service, a hierarchical SDN deployment approach provides the best solution, where the central, synchronized SDN controllers are augmented by dedicated, distributed SDN controllers being able to take over orphaned devices.This paper describes and analyzes a hierarchical SDN architecture where a centralized SDN controller cluster manages the network during regular operation, and making use of a distributed SDN approach to ensure business continuity during degraded operation. Finally, network performance advantages of the hierarchical approach compared to conventional central SDN cluster deployments are highlighted.\n",

This paper proposes Reliable and Load balance-aware Multi-controller Deployment (RLMD) strategy to address the above problems. Firstly, we establish a multiple-controller network model and define the relevant parameters for RLMD. Then, we design the corresponding algorithms to implement this strategy. By weighing node efficiency and path quality, Controller Placement Selection (CPS) algorithm is introduced to explore the reliable deployments of the controllers. On this basis, we design Multiple Domain Partition (MDP) algorithm to allocate switches for controllers according to node attractability and controller load balancing rate, which could realize the reasonable domain planning. Finally, the simulations show that, compared with the typical strategies, RLMD has the better performance in improving the reliability of the control plane and balancing the distribution of the controller loads.\n",

In this paper, an analytical model is proposed to study the performance of auxiliary connections with OpenFlow switches. This model characterizes different interactions between the controller and the auxiliary-connection-enabled switches with limited buffer space. The model produces evaluation results in seconds for switches with realistic data center traffic loads, which would require days of compute time with network simulation.

One of these problems is the Vulnerability of the software defined networks' architecture to distributed denial of service attacks on the network's controllers. One of the most recent distributed denial of service attacks which entropy-based methods are incapable of detecting, is to send fake packets with different source to random addresses in a software defined network. In this paper, given the SDN structure and tra □ ic analysis, a statistical trapezoid model is introduced to estimate number of table misses for each switch. Then, using the linear regression method and EWMA estimation, the threshold of the table misses in specified time intervals, is estimated. The evaluation results imply that using this method, one can detect DDoS attacks in early stage in software defined networks, regardless of the sort of DDoS attack.\n",

Communication infrastructure should provide quality-of-service essentials in terms of high-bandwidth capacity, scalability, resiliency, and security. Programmable networks are viewed as the prevailing method of encountering the challenges introduced by the accelerated expansion. The ability of software-defined networking (SDN) to separate the control plane from the data plane and enable the programmability of the network creates new ways to architect the network. The centralization of control logic introduces complexities in large-scale, distributed networks such as performance bottlenecks and reliability. Distributed SDN controllers have been proposed to overcome the performance concerns. The lack of a communication standard among distributed controllers, referred to as the East/West interface, presents a challenge in the adoption of SDN in large-scale, distributed networks. In this paper, we propose Distributed SDN control plane Framework (DSF) - a framework for the East/West interface for heterogeneous, distributed SDN controllers to synchronize topologies using a standardized data-centric real-time publish/subscribe paradigm known as the Data Distribution Service (DDS). Distributed control plane architectures are proposed using DSF: flat, hierarchical, and T-model. The DSF interface is implemented on multiple SDN control plane platforms to evaluate performance: Floodlight and Open Network Operating System (ONOS) controllers. Test cases with different configurations are designed for performance evaluation of the proposed interface in homogeneous and heterogeneous SDN control planes. In addition, a performance comparison is presented of DSF-based ONOS controllers versus Atomix-based ONOS cluster solutions.\n",

Reliability is considered for single-link failure. We model the problem of determining the optimal controller placement to provide low latencies in the control plane traffic. The objective of this study is to minimize the average accumulated latency by jointly taking into account the latency between controller to switches and inter-controller while optimizing their placement for achieving an optimal balance simultaneously. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model under the constraints of latency and reliability. We evaluated the performance of our proposed metric by using the Internet2 OS3E network topology.

      "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network architecture that provides programmable networking through a logically centralized controller. As SDN becomes more prominent, its security vulnerabilities become more evident than ever. Serving as the \"brain\" of a software-defined network, how the control plane (of the network) is exposed to external inputs (i.e., data plane messages) is directly correlated with how secure the network is. Fortunately, due to some unique SDN design choices (e.g., control plane and data plane separation), attackers often struggle to find a reachable path to those vulnerable logic hidden deeply within the control plane.In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible for a weak adversary who only controls a commodity network device (host or switch) to attack previously unreachable control plane components by maliciously increasing reachability in the control plane. We introduce D2C2 (data dependency creation and chaining) attack, which leverages some widely-used SDN protocol features (e.g., custom fields) to create and chain unexpected data dependencies in order to achieve greater reachability. We have developed a novel tool, SVHunter, which can effectively identify D2C2 vulnerabilities. Till now we have evaluated SVHunter on three mainstream open-source SDN controllers (i.e., ONOS, Floodlight, and Opendaylight) as well as one security-enhanced controller (i.e., SE-Floodlight). SVHunter detects 18 previously unknown vulnerabilities, all of which can be exploited remotely to launch serious attacks such as executing arbitrary commands, exfiltrating confidential files, and crashing SDN services.\n",

Software-Defined Networks (or SDN, for short) provides a flexible platform for the network monitoring and relies on a central controller and switches interact with each other to gain a global view of traffic. However, the computation resources for network monitoring in switches are limited in SDN. Thus, too many monitoring tasks will affect data plane traffic performance. To address this issue, we propose FlowSpy, which is a load balancing network monitoring framework using P4 (Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors) programming language in SDN. P4 program can specify how a switch processes packets, that can reduce the overhead of the interaction between data plane and control plane in SDN, and provides more flexibility for monitoring than OpenFlow-based SDN.

      "Technology has shaped numerous artefacts to get rid of manual, routine and laborious tasks. However, for this to transpire it is requirement for the next-generation networks to be fast, scalable, reliable and cost effective. Fascinatingly, Software defined networking (SDN) helps in distributing network capacity more effectively, dynamically adjusting to changeable demands, and managing failure more rapidly. We propose an SDN-based overlay solution for the existing traditional Wide Area Networks (WAN) environment, targeting provisioning flexibility and control in case of network failures, through a distributed SDN network overlay and edge SDN devices. The goal was to facilitate transition to SDN in developing economies through adoption of SDN while retaining legacy infrastructure. We present an SDN overlay on top of the existing WAN using the South African National Research Network (SANReN) network as a use case. We conducted an evaluation to ascertain which controller is suitable for the proposed WAN network overlay by examining the controller's highest throughput and lowest latency in relation to WAN as our use case. ONOS outshined the other three controller (Ryu, Floodlight and OpenDayLight) and was suitable for the implementation of proposed network solution. We implemented the proposed SDN-overlay on the WAN setup using SANReN topology to test the performance. The results showed improvements in the network performance when distributed control and edge nodes placement were implemented.\n",

      "Software Defined Network (SDN) can manage, design, and implement a data flow. Controllers from SDN in a network can control all data flow to make traffic more efficient, but it will be a severe problem if the controller is down. High availability can solve those problems. High Availability controllers divide into Primary and Secondary, and when the Primary Controller is off, the Secondary Controller will detect and replace the Primary Controller function. We can create a High Availability system in various ways. However, in this paper, the High Availability will use the Corosync Pacemaker method to compare it to the OpenDaylight SDN Controller Platform (OSCP) Clustering method. Corosync Pacemaker is a High Availability Proxy application that provides features on the controller that are ready to use and needs to be configured on a cluster system to be connected to the controller used from testing results and analysis. The conclusion is that high availability with the OSCP Clustering method is more stable when it occurs host and switch spikes than the Corosync Pacemaker method. OSCP Clustering is better to implement on a network because the required failover and failback times are relatively stable, and also the resulting QoS parameters have an excellent index.\n",

      "Virtualization and multi-tenancy are attractive paradigms to improve the utilization of computing infrastructures and hence to reduce costs. In order to provide a high degree of resource sharing without sacrificing predictable cloud application performance, strict performance isolation needs to be ensured. This is non-trivial and requires models which account for all components where applications may interfere: similarly to security, the predictability of cloud application performance can only be as good as the least predictable component in the model. This paper identifies a new source of potential performance interference that has been overlooked so far: the network hypervisor - a critical component in any multi-tenant network. We present a first measurement study of the performance implications of the network hypervisor in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). For the purpose of our study, we developed a new open-source benchmarking tool for OpenFlow control and data planes. We show that cloud application performance may appear unpredictable if the network hypervisor is not accounted for: the performance does not only depend on the specific hypervisor implementation and workload (e.g., OpenFlow message types), but also on the number of tenants and the size of the network. Hence, our results suggest that hypervisors should be included in our performance models, and their performance benchmarked and compared similarly to other crucial software components such as the SDN controller.\n",

      "In this paper, we propose a resilient control plane based on endogenous security for Software-Defined Networking (SDN) named SDN-ESRC to prevent vulnerability backdoor attacks. SDN-ESRC uses a set of heterogeneous controllers (e.g., RYU, OpenDayLight, ONOS) to compose the control plane and dynamically and adaptively selects several heterogeneous controller instances from the controller set to detect and correct the malicious control messages. The design of SDN-ESRC faces two challenges: (1) increasing network update delay due to multi-controller comparison and (2) maintaining high controllable security. To address the first challenge, SDN-ESRC adopts the master modification mode to reduce the network update delay and identify malicious control messages. To address the second challenge, SDN-ESRC introduces the comparison modification mode to ensure high availability in real time. We propose an evaluation model for SDN-ESRC and theoretically analyze the SDN-ESRC’s endogenous security performance under three typical backdoor attack scenarios. We implement SDN-ESRC in a prototype system and conduct simulations and experiments. The results show that SDN-ESRC can improve the backdoor damage attack security up to 98.3%, the backdoor random attack security up to 99.99%, and the backdoor coordinated attack security up to 82% at the cost of increasing network update delay less than 8.3%.\n",

SDN has introduced two main functions; centralized control and programmability which have become the pillars of SDN. In this paper we use SDN as a centralized architecture which is composed of a master-controller connected to a set of slave-controllers. Switches connect to slave-controllers forming clusters. In this paper, we introduce a new petri-net based mathematical framework for SDN fault tolerance. The proposed model is called Fault Tolerance using Petri-nets for SDN networks (FTPNSDN). Simulation results show a significant improvement in the availability of the network when compared to a reference model. The model shows stability after controller failures. Petri net capability functions are used to sort the backup controllers to take over in case of failure in descending order. This helps the switch to be aware of the next controller to take over next and avoid interruption of service. Results show an improvement of above 10% improvement in terms of transition time before another controller takes over which leads to an improved fault tolerance of the network. Packet delays are reduced by 12% when compared to Hyperflow reference model.\n",

      "The rigidity of traditional network architectures, with tightly coupled control and data planes, impair their ability to adapt to the dynamic requirements of future application domains, such as the Tactile Internet or Holographic-Type Communications. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architectures, which provide programmability to configure the network, have the potential to provide the required dynamism. However, given its centralized essence, SDN suffers from scalability issues. Therefore, efforts have been made to propose alternative decentralized solutions, such as the flat distributed SDN architecture. Despite its potential, the real applicability and scalability of decentralized SDN solutions are still open research questions. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the effects of different routing approaches on the scalability of flat distributed SDN architectures. Using the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) as our evaluation architecture, we have studied the tradeoff between routing overhead in the control data plane and inter-controller communications for different degrees of decentralization. We have found that routing applications, which only require control-data plane communication for setting the path, benefit more from decentralization than the ones which utilize inter-controller communications and ensure Quality of Service (QoS). Our findings highlight the need for efficient routing mechanisms to deal with inter-controller overhead while lowering the amount of control-data plane communication.\n",

      "Service Functions have become a prominent part of cloud data center networks. Providing qualitative services to the hosted applications, the provision and management of service function chain components require an autonomous and reactive management framework that can respond to the dynamics of network state and application requirements. While software defined network controllers enable programmable network configuration, current implementations do not extend its capability to manage service function chains. Hence, a common network control entity that manages not only forwarding devices, but also the service function chain components is required. With a global view of the network which includes the service functions, the integrated controller can make network configuration decisions that are globally optimized. However, this integration gives rise to the problems of controller scalability and multi-tenancy management. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical controller framework for software defined network controller integrated with service function chain management that addresses both these problems in cloud data centers. The proposed controller is implemented and evaluated over a simulated data center network, and a comparative evaluation is made with existing controller architectures. The proposed controller is observed to reduce packet loss by 19.81% and 9.37% in comparison to centralized and distributed controller frameworks with integrated SFC management, respectively. Also, while the centralized controller gives the least flow setup times for smaller number of tenants, beyond 70 tenants the proposed hierarchical controller gives the least flow setup times.\n",

      "Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes it easy to control and manage the network due to a centralized control plane. However, this centralization also limits the scalability of SDN. To address this scalability issue, multiple controllers are deployed in the SDN. Placing multiple controllers poses several challenges, one of which is to find optimum locations for the placement of multiple controllers. The existing approaches for controller placement in a multiple-controller SDN environment overlook many aspects, like the path reliability for switch-to-controller and controller-to-controller communication, and the use of an efficient machine-learning algorithm. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel approach, named as CMOPHA, that uses NSGA-II (a multi-objective optimization MOO algorithm) to compute the optimum placement of controllers based on the parameters of maximum switch-to-controller path reliability, and minimum value of switch-to-controller hop count, maximum controller-to-controller reliability, load-balancing among the controllers and a minimum number of controllers. We conduct simulations using real network traces. Based on the results, we show that CMOPHA improves the network performance in terms of end-to-end delay, hop count, computation time, and network availability compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.\n",

      "The phenomenon known as \"Internet ossification\" describes the process through which certain components of the Internet’s older design have become immovable at the present time. This presents considerable challenges to the adoption of IPv6 and makes it hard to implement IP multicast services. For new applications such as data centers, cloud computing and virtualized networks, improved network availability, improved internal and external domain routing, and seamless user connectivity throughout the network are some of the advantages of Internet growth. To meet these needs, we've developed Software Defined Networking for the Future Internet (SDN). When compared to current networks, this new paradigm emphasizes control plane separation from network-forwarding components. To put it another way, this decoupling enables the installation of control plane software (such as Open Flow controller) on computer platforms that are substantially more powerful than traditional network equipment (such as switches/routers). This research describes Mininet’s routing techniques for a virtualized software-defined network. There are two obstacles to overcome when attempting to integrate SDN in an LTE/WiFi network. The first problem is that external network load monitoring tools must be used to measure QoS settings. Because of the increased demand for real-time load balancing methods, service providers cannot adopt QoS-based routing. In order to overcome these issues, this research suggests a router configuration method. Experiments have proved that the network coefficient matrix routing arrangement works, therefore it may provide an answer to the above-mentioned concerns. The Java-based SDN controller outperforms traditional routing systems by nine times on average highest sign to sound ratio. The study’s final finding suggests that the field’s future can be forecast. We must have a thorough understanding of this emerging paradigm to solve numerous difficulties, such as creating the Future Internet and dealing with its obliteration problem. In order to address these issues, we will first examine current technologies and a wide range of current and future SDN projects before delving into the most important issues in this field in depth.\n",

Software-defined network (SDN) provides network management and controlling features irrespective of the hardware configurations and network infrastructure. Network slicing is the process of separation of multiple virtual networks based on different functions or tasks such that one application does not interfere with another network. Network slicing allows separating the control plane from the user's plane. Various investigators have investigated how the slices that have been used for splitting paths can be measured to improve durability. In SDN, the dynamic migration of switches offers a method of offloading the load from one controller to another controller. We have reintroduced the concept of the network (dataflow) splitting for load balancing in SDN. In this paper, we compare the performance techniques and found that the splitting paradigm with dynamic migration offers the most balanced network flow and least overhead on the SDN controller.\n",

      "The process of network management has always been complicated and challenging in traditional networks. Network operators in traditional networks have to cope with unavoidable constraints of low level vendor specific configurations to implement network policies on different networking devices from multiple vendors. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, there were still several complicated and scalability issues remained unresolved particularly in scenarios where multivendor networking devices are deployed over large networks. This rigid behavior of vendor specific underlying infrastructure devices configuration and maintenance results in very few possibilities for innovation, enhancement, and improvement since the networking devices have generally been closed and proprietary. This lack of coherence in different vendor specific networking infrastructure devices was acting as a point of main hindrance in making the network management process a simple and easy to operate for network operators. The future avionics communications network being heterogeneous wireless communications network as presented in Future Communications Infrastructure (FCI) document also foresees similar network management issues.The paradigm of Software Defined Networking (SDN) proposes an effective way of tackling the issues in network management by separating the control and management plane from the data plane. The core idea of SDN is to keep networking devices i.e. switches and routers in the forwarding or data plane, responsible for simply forwarding data packets. A logically centralized software program i.e. SDN controller will be responsible of all the intelligent work of control plane operations. It also allows the network to be more flexible and programable. Using this paradigm, the SDN introduces new routes of innovations and opportunities for network management and configuration methods. In this paper an SDN based network management architecture is presented for future avionics communication network based on FCI. This paper also presents a comparison of network management process in traditional and SDN based architecture with the underlying configuration and management protocols i.e. SNMP, OF-Config, NetConf, RestConf and Yang model. The issues in the state-of-the-art network management such as configurations and scalability issues are highlighted with alternative solutions in SDN based architecture. The SDN based network management functions are applied to future avionics communications network architecture. Some example scenarios have also been demonstrated for network management functions such as configuration/reconfiguration of infrastructure layers devices using SDN controller with a global view of network.\n",

One of the most important types of networks that have gained more attention is the Software Defined Networks (SDN), which is based on the principle of separation between the control plane and the data plane. This in turn made the network control centralized and programmable through a centralized controller that is managed by a protocol called OpenFlow. When the main OpenFlow protocol is used, the challenge of time usage in the process of creating communication channels becomes evident each time packets are transmitted. Therefore, this research intends to propose an enhanced algorithm to improve the network performance by integrating the idea of userspace that was successful with operating systems and activating it within SDN networks. The proposed OpenFlow based on UserSpace (OFUS) has been analyzed and compared to the OpenFlow-enabled SDN networks in terms of Round Trip Time (RTT) and the network throughput as performance measurements. The comparative analysis was made by using the open-source Mininet network simulator. The comparative analysis done by using open-source Mininet network simulator on four types of topologies. The results of the enhanced algorithm OFUS showed that the performance of the network has been improved for the RTT and throughput compare to OpenFlow-enabled networks.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been applied more and more in recent years as a solution for IoT challenges. The SDN concept of decoupling the control plane from the data plane promotes logically centralized visibility of the entire network and enables the applications to innovate through network programmability. At the same time, there are still some open issues, such as scalability in large IoT environments that include several devices. To face scalability challenges, SDN proposes distributed controllers as a solution to decentralize the control plane while maintaining the logically centralized network view. However, SDN-based architecture, that provides the flexibility and scalability, still lacks the smart or intelligent management to self-adapt to possible dynamic network topology changes. To over-come such issues, we propose a framework that answers automatically the business demands and makes the network self-adaptive. The topology deployment decision is made based on information that the controller gives. So for making sure that our proposed framework gives the best results, we have to study first the topology discovery mechanism in a distributed controller. In this paper, we introduce a self-adaptive management framework of SDN controllers for highly dynamic IoT networks. We evaluate performances of the two most popular distributed SDN controllers (i.e. ONOS and ODL) in a realistic scenario where the network topology changes dynamically. Results show the outperforming of ONOS compared to ODL in discovering the highly dynamic IoT network.\n",

The centralized logical controller provides more control over the total network, which has complete network visibility. These SDN advantages expose the network to vulnerabilities and the impact of the attacks is much severe when compared to traditional networks, where the network devices have protection from the attacks and limits the occurrence of attacks. In this paper, we proposed an entropy based algorithm in SDN to detect as well as stopping distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the servers or clouds or hosts. Firstly, there explored various attacks that can be launched on SDN at different layers. Basically DDoS is one kind of denial of service attack in which an attacker uses multiple distributed sources for attacking a particular server. Every network in a system has an entropy and an increase in the randomness of probability causes entropy to decrease. In comparison with previous entropy based approaches this approach has higher performance in distinguishing legal and illegal traffics and blocking illegal traffic paths. Linux OS and Mininet Simulator along with POX controller are used to validate the proposed approach. By conducting pervasive simulation along with theoretical analysis this method can definitely detect and stop DDoS attacks automatically.\n",

The algorithm is implemented and tested on the open network operating system (ONOS) controller, which facilitates evaluation of the algorithm's performance in real networks. A comparison study between the proposed SAQL algorithm, the classical Q-learning ε-greedy exploration algorithm and traditional OSPF was carried out on two topologies. Results show that SAQL achieved around 60% less average control power than the standard OSPF and ε-greedy approaches while maintaining a relatively low latency of 0.280 ms in Nsfnet topology. Simulation results confirm that SAQL routing algorithm managed to balance the trade-off between energy-aware and QoS-aware routing.\n",

      "Software Defined Networking (SDN) has revolutionized the networking industry and also tactical communication due to its flexibility, innovation, and ease of programmability. However, modeling, evaluation, and testing of SDN based applications present several challenges. Mininet simulator has been developed for the study of SDN and used for SDN simulation in general. Although it is possible to prototype virtual SDN networks fast with Mininet, it is not for stress testing to validate the stability and reliability and simulation suitable for the real environment. The state-of-the-art network simulation tool OPNET recently OPNET has introduced the SDN Model, which can be used with a system in the loop (SITL). However, there is no research published yet which shows the use of OPNET for SDN. This paper rigorously compares the OPNET and Mininet for SDN experiments. we compare end-to-end delay, jitter, and RTT between controllers and switches. As a result, the Mininet environment cannot apply the network load, so it is desirable to use OPNET for simulation of the real environment or for the stability and reliability test.\n",

      "Software Defined Networks (SDN) are a novel class of networking solutions in which the traditional paradigm of distributed networking has been replaced with centralized networking approach in which a central controller or a group of controllers make the optimal decisions and the nodes become merely forwarding switches. Similar to the wired domain, Software-Defined Wireless Mesh Networks (SDWMNs) SDWMNs leverage the power of centralized decision making to reap the benefits of sophisticated mathematical optimization models in wireless networks. However, there are several issues including controller placement that remain to be addressed for SDWMNs compared to their wired counterparts. The controller placement problem has received significant attention for wired networks, but is an open research area for software-defined mesh networks. The problem is harder because of the wireless channel including interference (collisions, retransmissions, bit errors etc.) and especially since the wireless channel is used for control messages as well. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for the problem of optimal controller placement in SDWMNs. The proposed algorithm efficiently places N controllers at optimal positions in the network so as to minimize interference compared to random deployment of controllers. Simulation results show the better performance of our solution with random deployment.\n",

      "Software Defined Networking (SDN) offers a flexible and scalable architecture that abstracts decision making away from individual devices and provides a programmable network platform. Low-power wireless Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where multi-tenant and multi-application architectures require scalable and configurable solutions, are ideally placed to capitalize on this research. However, implementing a centralized SDN architecture within the constraints of a low-power wireless network faces considerable challenges. Not only is controller traffic subject to jitter due to unreliable links and network contention, but the overhead generated by SDN can severely affect the performance of other traffic. This paper addresses the challenge of bringing high-overhead SDN architecture to IEEE 802.15.4 networks. We explore how the traditional view of SDN needs to evolve in order to overcome the constraints of low-power wireless networks, and discuss protocol and architectural optimizations necessary to reduce SDN control overhead - the main barrier to successful implementation. Additionally, we argue that interoperability with the existing protocol stack is necessary to provide a platform for controller discovery, and coexistence with legacy networks. We consequently introduce μSDN, a lightweight SDN framework for Contiki OS with both IPv6 and underlying routing protocol interoperability, as well as optimizing a number of elements within the SDN architecture to reduce control overhead to practical levels. We evaluate μSDN in terms of latency, energy, and packet delivery. Through this evaluation we show how the cost of SDN control overhead (both bootstrapping and management) can be reduced to a point where comparable performance and scalability is achieved against an IEEE 802.15.4-2012 RPL-based network. Additionally, we demonstrate μSDN through simulation: providing a use-case where the SDN configurability can be used to provide Quality of Service (QoS) for critical network flows experiencing interference, and we achieve considerable reductions in delay and jitter in comparison to a scenario without SDN.\n",

How to accurately and effectively detect DDoS attacks has always been a difficult point and focus of SDN security research. Based on the characteristics of SDN, a DDoS attack detection method combining generalized entropy and PSO-BP neural network is proposed. The traffic is pre-detected by the generalized entropy method deployed on the switch, and the detection result is divided into normal and abnormal. Locate the switch that issued the abnormal alarm. The controller uses the PSO-BP neural network to detect whether a DDoS attack occurs by further extracting the flow features of the abnormal switch.

The exponential growth of traffic that circulates through the network, together with the changing demand for bandwidth, types of traffic, and the need for rapid deployment of new services, have put into focus the traditional mechanisms in which device configurations are performed manually and statically. Consequently, there is a need to change the design and administration mechanisms to give the network greater dynamism and intelligence. Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Automation emerge as revolutionary new network technologies, which promise to provide concrete solutions to these demands. This work tries to relate the needs of traditional networks with what SDN provides, for the analysis of performance and new management capabilities. A simulated laboratory is presented, that allowed different scenarios. For this, different tools for simulation and virtualization were used, such as GNS3, Mininet and ONOS (Open Network Operating System). Within GNS3, topologies were created with Mininet version 2.2.2, connected to the SDN ONOS controller for the required cases. Among some tests, it was possible to determine the shortest convergence time before the fall of links or switchs, for SDN networks compared to traditional networks. The numerical results can be useful for simulation analysts, and network planners and administrators.\n",

      "Available bandwidth in network is limited, it is very critical to manage the network bandwidth efficiently. In this research, bandwidth management model based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture is examined. Through the recommended model, real-time traffic over network was given importance to approach the restricted bandwidth over non real-time traffic. SDN promises the simplification of network management compared to the traditional network. SDN architecture breaks the vertically integrated current network design and it introduces centralized network control through the SDN controller, which is considered as the greatest contribution of SDN in networking area. SDN architecture is adopted in this paper since it promotes centralized control features which enable grid programmability and supports improve network resources administration. Simulation was conducted using the EstiNet network simulator. Two groups of experiments with different situations have been conducted. Each experiment consisted of five simulations with different number of sender and receiver nodes. The first experiment simulated the traffics in a traditional networking; and the second experiment simulated the traffics in a proposed network model. In addition, bulk of the existing bandwidth was reserved to real-time traffic and the remaining quantity was reserved for non-real-time traffic. The real-time throughput results of the two different experiments have been compared to estimate the performance of the proposed SDN research model. The experiment results presented that the recommended model has successfully given urgency to real-time network traffic to approach the limited network bandwidth. As the number of nodes increases, the conventional real-time throughput of setup one and setup two decreases linearly. When nodes reach 10, the real-time ordinary throughput of setup one and setup two are 63SKBps and 473KBps respectively.\n",

      "Given the rate at which communication technologies and protocols evolve, network operators are often cautious of fully migrating to a new technology like Software Defined Networking (SDN) at one go, and prefer to do so in phases. Consequently, the number of SDN switches and in turn the amount of SDN control traffic in the network increases gradually. This control traffic processing occurs at the SDN controller(s), which are, hence, required incrementally in such hybrid SDN/legacy networks. The placement of these controllers significantly affects several aspects such as control latency, resiliency, and load balancing. All existing controller placement strategies place controller(s) in a pure SDN network at a point in time, which is contrary to the SDN predominant migration scenario described above. Even when suitably adapted for hybrid networks, the existing controller placement strategies lead to inefficient placements. In this paper, we introduce and formulate the controller placement problem for hybrid SDN/legacy networks over a period of time, with an aim to maximize the switch-controller control channel resilience. We consider an SDN migration trajectory and deduce a resilient controller placement schedule using an optimization approach. Based on 138 real network topologies, we comprehensively evaluate our approach against a well-known existing resilient controller placement strategy (suitably adapted herein for hybrid SDN/legacy networks for a fair comparison), and demonstrate that our approach is more effective with up to 77% higher resiliency, while requiring up to 33% fewer controllers.\n",

      "Software-defined networks (SDNs) are key parts of the next generation networks owing to their high programmability and agility that traditional networks lack. However, the SDN controller is vulnerable to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Once the SDN controller was unavailable due to the DDoS attack, all real-time services will be down immediately. Since the advantage of SDN is to process massive network data much faster, we need a real-time detecting algorithm to reduce the impact caused by the attack. To ensure the security of both the users and the SDN, we proposed a detection and defense mechanism against DDoS attacks in Software-defined networking (SDN) environments. The implementation of detection was based on the unbalance in the traffic distribution. The traffic unbalance can be detected by a clustering algorithm such as the K-Means algorithm. Furthermore, we used a Packet_IN message register to filter malicious packets and experimentally evaluated the performance of our scheme in terms of detection accuracy, defense effect, communication delay, and packet loss rate. The results show that our detection method is adaptable to defend against attacks of different scales and types and ensures the least possible decline in the quality of services.\n",

These controllers’ behavior is determined by the installed environment, network architecture, and kind of traffic flow, among other factors. It’s crucial to compare these controllers in order to learn more about their capabilities. The performance of python-based controllers in Abilene topology is evaluated in this research.

Then it uses OpenFlow protocol and communication within the SDN architecture. A particularly important task in SDN architectures is that of controller placement, i.e., the positioning of a limited number of resources within a network in order to meet various requirements. These requirements range from latency constraints to failure tolerance and load balancing. The controller placement problem (CPP) is one of the key challenges of software defined networks to increase performance. Given the locations of switches, CPP consists of choosing the controller locations that minimize the latency between switches and controllers. In this paper the controller placement problem is introduced that consists of (i) determining the locations of controller modules to bound communication latencies, and of (ii) determining the number of controllers per module to support the load. In this work ns-3.26 and OpenFlowSwitch (OFS) version 1.3 are used for the demonstration of the proposed strategies. If the nodes in the SDN doesn't have the routing information then the proposed model first time communicates through adaptive controller. The involvement of controller in communication is adaptively identified. Then for the further communication only nodes will communicate without controller. The proposed methodology is simulated using NetAnim. This paper also presents the evaluation of the proposed methodology on the basis of various parameters.\n",

      "Recently, computer networks become one of the main components of the business processes in most organizations in the world. The size and complexity of network systems also continue to rapidly grow every year. When the networks become larger, many traffic flows are likely to propagate in the network at the same time. This event can lead to multiple performance problems, such as congestion, and slow response time. Traffic distribution mechanism is one of the main solutions for solving congestion problem. It aims to reduce the probability of congestion by splitting the traffic load into multiple paths. Furthermore, applying traffic distribution technique with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a promising solution that can effectively support both large-scale network implementation and also does not add high level of complexity to the network system. In this paper, the traffic distribution mechanism based on modified OpenFlow is proposed. The proposed method aims to decrease response time that a SDN switch must wait for the control message back from the SDN controller. It can be achieved by allowing the SDN controller to add the new flow entries for distributing the traffic load before the packet arrives at the SDN switch. The simulation experiments are conducted in Mininet to compare the performance between the proposed traffic distribution mechanism (TDm) and the traffic distribution mechanism based on OpenFlow (TDo). The results from the experiments show that TDm can provide much better performance in term of End-to-End delay (E2E delay) and Packet delivery ratio (PDR) than TDo in most of the experiment scenarios. However, both traffic distribution mechanisms (TDo and TDm) cannot provide good performance in term of E2E delay and PDR when the data transmission rate equals or higher than 500 Mbps. As a result, Time-Sleep mechanism is proposed to implement in SDN controller. The results from the simulation experiments show that Time-Sleep mechanism can notably improve the overall performance of both TDo and TDm even when the data transmission rate is high.\n",

      "Traditional networks rely on aggregate routing and decentralized control to achieve scalability. On the contrary, software-defined networks achieve near optimal network performance and policy-based management through per-flow routing and centralized control, which, however, face scalability challenge due to: 1) limited ternary content addressable memory and on-die memory for storing the forwarding table and 2) per-flow communication/computation overhead at the controller. This paper presents a novel hybrid switching (HS) design, which integrates traditional switching and software-defined networking (SDN) switching for the purpose of achieving both scalability and optimal performance. We show that the integration also leads to unexpected benefits of making both types of switching more efficient under the hybrid design. We also design the general optimization framework via HS and propose an approximation algorithm for load-balancing optimization as a case study. Testing and numerical evaluation demonstrate the superior performance of HS when comparing with the state-of-the-art SDN design.\n",

Since software-defined networking is a powerful technique to support today's networks' manageability and scalability, both wireless sensor networks and software-defined networks combined are gaining significant interest in research and industry. In this paper, we introduce an approach to handle the mobility and disconnectivity of the sensor nodes in a software-defined network. This approach takes advantage of splitting the network into sub-networks by its address based on subnetting wireless sensor networks (Sub-WSN) and keeping the network topology up to date in the controller by exchanging periodical hello messages. We treat all the nodes in the network as mini controllers and implement an application into the controllers to hand over nodes between the subnets. We evaluated the proposed approach by using Cooja simulator in Contiki.

Decoupling of control plane and data plane in SDN enables the centralized control of the network, providing flexibility to a great extent. On the other hand, NC has shown immense potential for improving robustness and security when deployed on VANET. This article advocates for the design of an architecture which exercises the SDN concept by incorporating NC with multigeneration-mixing (MGM) functionalities to increase reliability as well as security of data transmission in vehicular networks. We design an MGM-based NC protocol for encoding and decoding of data. Moreover, a centralized SDN controller takes charge of authentication of vehicles. Finally, we build a simulation model based on realistic traffic and communication characteristics.

However, managing and controlling these UAVs in changing scenarios can be challenging specifically in large-scale network scenarios. As a promising method of administering these networks, software-defined networking (SDN) can be a good choice compared to traditional networking due to its automated, centralized, and intellectual controllability. Therefore, to meet the future sixth-generation wireless communication requirements with high network availability, improved communication convergence, and intelligent features, a software-defined UAV (SDUAV) networking framework is proposed in this work. To enhance the reliability and scalability, and to reduce the single-point failure issues of this network, a multi-SDN controller-based approach is also deployed in this newly designed architecture. Besides, to solve the load balancing and fault tolerance problems like controller overhead or cascading failure, an adaptive load balancing algorithm as well as a robust hybrid routing algorithm are developed, accordingly. In addition, to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, a mathematical model is proposed by using the M/M/1 and M/M/c queueing systems at the primary and secondary controllers, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed model reduces the packet processing time by 60%, 44%, and 25% in terms of packet arrival rate, service rate, and utilization factor, respectively, compared to the existing control-domain adjustment algorithm.\n",

      "Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a rapidly emerging technology in the commercial market, and is a technology that should be embraced by the defence and emergency services to enable more flexible and adaptable communication networks in the future. Common deployment of SDN, especially in data centres, involves building a separate network for the control channel between forwarding devices and the SDN controllers. For geographically distributed networks typically found in defence and emergency services, it is often not feasible to establish a separate dedicated network for the control channel. In such networks, traffic between SDN controllers and forwarding devices therefore needs to be in-band in the same network that the SDN controllers should control. This paper describes the steps necessary for forwarding devices to both discover and set up the connections with SDN controllers when in-band control channels must be used. The work expands on earlier published work on setting up in-band control channels between SDN controllers and the forwarding devices. Especially, our solution that uses the \"Intent frameworks\" of major SDN controllers improves on network resilience in disconnected, intermittent and limited networks and the solution will allow for implementation of enhanced security mechanisms compared to previous work.\n",

This can be achieved with the help of a new networking technology, called Software Defined Networking (SDN). The concept of SDN is to decouple the control plane from the forwarding plane of a network to improve the performance of the networking applications. Traffic Engineering (TE) is a domain of network applications that manages the network traffic, and try to optimize the network resources. SDN offers multiple features to support TE applications. SDN combined with WSN forms a new networking domain called Software Defined WSN (SDWSN). Since WSN has resource-constrained nodes, resource optimization is a need in WSN. This paper proposes an optimized link utilization based approach for TE in SDWSN. The proposed approach discusses about a traffic optimization algorithm, called Optimized Link Allocation based TE (OLA-TE). OLA-TE is implemented at the controller node and helps to improve the overall network utilization. The SDN sensor nodes find the optimized path for traffic routing with the help of controller node. The proposed approach is compared with the traditional WSN approach. IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio and MATLAB are used for validation purposes. The CPLEX results assure a network flow-cost optimization of about 10%. The results of MATLAB show that despite having extra control traffic on network, the network performance gets improved over the period of time.\n",

In our previous work, we introduced SECO, an SDN Secure Controller algorithm to detect and defend SDN against DoS attacks. Simulation results showed that SECO successfully defends SDN networks from DoS attacks. In this paper, we present SDN sEcure COntrol and Data Plane (SECOD), which is an improved version of SECO.

Control and data planes are merged onto a single device, unlike conventional networks. As the number of infiltration attempts soars, so does the efficacy of the security mechanisms in OpenFlow networks. The OpenFlow protocol, unlike more typical network protocols, ignores certain security concerns, making it difficult to strike a balance between security and speed. Using OpenFlow's firewall module, this research aims to develop a solution that improves SDN security and speed. To be able to detect traffic and enforce defined rules, the firewall application was developed on the SDN control layer as well as layers two, three, and four of the TCP/IP architecture. Using the open virtual switch and the floodlight SDN controller, we conducted tests. Before installing the firewall, the network connection was tested in two different ways. This time the firewall was turned on. The findings demonstrate that the SDN firewall established has a little impact on the SDN's operational efficiency. Round trip time (RTT) is almost identical, with a slightly longer delay time of 0.09 ms compared to the SDN without a firewall (0.068 to 0.069 ms), a little higher maximum throughput of 4.34 gbps compared to the SDN without a firewall (4.07 gbps), and no data loss in both circumstances. In other words, security is enhanced by packet processing, while speed is not adversely affected by matching rules. This research recommends the use of L3 learning switches to perform routing functions in distributed firewalls, in order to lessen the burden on the controller.

      "Fault Tolerant Controller Placement in Distributed SDN Environments\n",
      "-----\n",
      "Software Defined Network (SDN) facilitates a centralized networking system where a controller manages the global view of the network. The introduction of Software-Defined Networks and standards such as OpenFlow spawn several questions regarding scalability and reliability. One such question is the controller placement problem; i.e. given a topology, the problem of determining how many controllers are needed, and where they should be placed. This question has been well-studied relative to performance, but there has not been a focus on maximizing fault-tolerance. In this paper, we present a model for controller placement to account for fault-tolerance and compare our algorithm to existing algorithms. Our proposed solution was analyzed to determine where controllers should be placed on a wide range of topologies from the Internet Topology Zoo. We further evaluated the dependence of fault-tolerance over the range of available number of controllers.\n",

      "Latency and Reliability Aware SDN Controller: A Role Delegation Function as a Service\n",
      "-----\n",
      "The emergency of machine type and ultra-reliable low latency communication is imposing stringent constraints for service provisioning. Addressing such constraints is challenging for network and cloud service providers. As a trending paradigm, software-defined networking (SDN) plays a significant role in future networks and services. However, the classical implementation of the SDN controller has limitations in-terms-of latency and reliability since the controller is decoupled from the forwarding device. Several research works have tried to tackle these challenges by proposing solutions such as Devoflow, DIFANE, and hierarchical and distributed controller deployment. Nonetheless, these approaches are not fully addressing these challenges. This paper tries to address the problem of latency and reliability by proposing a dynamic controller role delegation architecture for forwarding devices. To align with the microservice or multi-agent-based service-based architecture, the role delegation function as a service is proposed. The dynamic role delegation enables to predict and (pre-)installed flow rules in the forwarding devices based on various considerations such as network state, packet type, and service's stringent requirements. The proposed architecture is implemented and evaluated for latency and resiliency performance in comparison to the centralized and distributed deployment of the SDN controller. We used ComNetsEmu, a softwarized network emulation tool, to emulate SDN and NFV (Network Function Virtualization). The result indicated a significant decrease in latency and improved resilience in case of failure, yielding better network performance.\n",

      "A Flow-Based Anomaly Detection Approach With Feature Selection Method Against DDoS Attacks in SDNs\n",
      "-----\n",
      "Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network platform, which facilitates centralised network management. The SDN enables the network operators to manage the overall network consistently and holistically, regardless the complexity of infrastructure devices. The promising features of the SDN enhance network security and facilitate the implementation of threat detection systems through software applications using open APIs. However, the emerging technology creates new security concerns and new threats that do not exist in the current traditional networks. Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) are one of the most rampant attacks that can interrupt the functionality of the network and make most of the network services unreachable for network users. The efficient identification of DDos attacks on SDN environments in literature is still a challenge because of the number of network features taken into account and the overhead of applying machine learning based anomaly detection techniques. Hence, in this paper, we aim to use two popular feature selection methods, i.e., Information Gain (IG) and Random Forest (RF) in order to analyse the most comprehensive relevant features of DDoS attacks in SDN networks. Using the most relevant features will improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection system and reduce the false alarm rates. Moreover, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) technique based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoencoder to tackle the problem of DDoS attacks in SDNs. We perform our analysis and evaluation on three different datasets, i.e., InSDN, CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018. We also measure the overhead of the proposed DL model on the SDN controller and test the network performance in terms of network throughput and end-to-end latency. The results validate that the DL approach can efficiently identify DDoS attacks in SDN environments without any significant degradation in the controller performance.\n",

      "Securing SDN Enabled IoT Scenario Infrastructure of Fog Networks From Attacks\n",
      "-----\n",
      "Nowadays, lives are very much easier with the help of IoT. Due to lack of protection and a greater number of connections, the management of IoT becomes more difficult To manage the network flow, a Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been introduced. The SDN has a great capability in automatic and dynamic distribution. For harmful attacks on the controller a centralized SDN architecture unlocks the scope. Therefore, to reduce these attacks in real-time, a securing SDN enabled IoT scenario infrastructure of Fog networks is preferred. The virtual switches have network enforcement authorized decisions and these are executed through the SDN network. Apart from this, SDN switches are generally powerful machines and simultaneously these are used as fog nodes. Therefore, SDN looks like a good selection for Fog networks of IoT. Moreover, dynamically distributing the necessary crypto keys are allowed by the centralized and software channel protection management solution, in order to establish the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTIS) tunnels between the IoT devices, when demanded by the cyber security framework. Through the extensive deployment of this combination, the usage of CPU is observed to be 30% between devices and the latencies are in milliseconds range, and thus it presents the system feasibility with less delay. Therefore, by comparing with the traditional SDN, it is observed that the energy consumption is reduced by more than 90%.\n",

      "DynamiTE: Dynamic Traffic Engineering in Software-Defined Cyber Physical Systems\n",
      "-----\n",
      "Next-generation cyber physical systems (CPS) face a variety of challenges in terms of networking, interoperability and scalability in the presence of heterogeneous devices. Recent advances in software-defined networking (SDN) make it a viable approach towards addressing these issues by introducing programmability and flexibility in the network. However, the elasticity of scale required by CPS raises some concerns about the control-overhead of the OpenFlow protocol. In this paper, we propose a dynamic traffic engineering scheme, DynamiTE, in software-defined cyber physical systems (SD-CPS). Our aim is to minimize the control overhead at the SDN controller by minimizing the number of PACKET-IN messages. We propose a greedy heuristic approach to determine the optimal number of switches required to have higher ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), termed as candidate switches, compared to the other switches in the network. In such a scenario, a fully occupied switch directly forwards a new incoming flow to a candidate switch without sending a PACKET-IN message to the SDN controller. Further, a packet-tagging method is applied to notify the SDN controller about the congestion occurred at the fully occupied switch. Simulation results show that DynamiTE is capable of reducing the number of PACKET-IN messages by 10% compared to the OpenFlow-based reactive forwarding schemes (OFS). Further, the number of packets experiencing congestion in the network is reduced by 38%, compared to the randomized forwarding scheme (RFS).\n",

      "Performance Comparison of Software-Defined Network Controllers\n",
      "-----\n",
      "The concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) was introduced to replace the current network infrastructures suffering from being highly hardware-based, inflexible to change and development, error-prone for the configuration of proprietary devices, etc. Optimistically though, SDN is set to address these challenges by its intrinsic merits including its centralized software-based architecture with vendor-neutral devices, flexibility to change and development, the programmability of data transmission functionalities. Nevertheless, it has yet to be fully developed and implemented. One major reason behind this setback is believed to be a lack of advancement of a controller for centralized management of the SDN environment. To achieve a highly advanced and reliable controller, first, it is vital to find the most essential features and capabilities of the current controllers. With this, the paper intends to first, compare ten major existing SDN controllers against various essential criteria and then evaluate the scalability and performance based on various topologies using mininet, an SDN network emulator. Ultimately, after conducting both evaluative stages, the key results and contributions of this paper are 1. A detailed list of all the key features and capabilities that every controller must entail 2. Python-based controllers cannot meet the high performance and low latency in large networks whereas Java and C-based controllers can offer better scalability and performance 3. A verdict on the most suitable controller based on the Multi-Criteria Decision Making technique.\n",
