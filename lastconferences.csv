While the network plays a crucial role in RPC performance, traditional traffic classification categories cannot sufficiently capture their importance due to wide variations in RPC characteristics. As a result, meeting service-level objectives (SLOs), especially for performance-critical (PC) RPCs, remains challenging.We present Aequitas, a distributed sender-driven admission control scheme that uses commodity Weighted-Fair Queuing (WFQ) to guarantee RPC-level SLOs. In the presence of network overloads, it enforces cluster-wide RPC latency SLOs by limiting the amount of traffic admitted into any given QoS and downgrading the rest. We show analytically and empirically that this simple scheme works well. When the network demand spikes beyond provisioned capacity, Aequitas achieves a latency SLO that is 3.8× lower than the state-of-art congestion control at the 99.9th-p and admits up to 2× more PC RPCs meeting SLO when compared with pFabric, Qjump, D3, PDQ, and Homa.

TDTCP recognizes that communication in these fabrics happens over a set of paths, each having its own physical characteristics and cross traffic. TDTCP multiplexes each connection across multiple independent congestion states—one for each distinct path—while managing connection-wide tasks in a shared fashion. It leverages network support to receive timely notification of path changes and promptly matches its local view to the current path. We implement TDTCP in the Linux kernel.

As the buffer-per-bandwidth-unit in datacenter decreases, the need for optimal buffer utilization becomes more pressing. Typical devices use a hierarchical packet admission control scheme: First, a Buffer Management (BM) scheme decides the maximum length per queue at the device level and then an Active Queue Management (AQM) scheme decides which packets will be admitted at the queue level. Unfortunately, the lack of cooperation between the two control schemes leads to (i) harmful interference across queues, due to the lack of isolation; (ii) increased queueing delay, due to the obliviousness to the per-queue drain time; and (iii) thus unpredictable burst tolerance. To overcome these limitations, we propose ABM, Active Buffer Management which incorporates insights from both BM and AQM. Concretely, ABM accounts for both total buffer occupancy (typically used by BM) and queue drain time (typically used by AQM). We analytically prove that ABM provides isolation, bounded buffer drain time and achieves predictable burst tolerance without sacrificing throughput. We empirically find that ABM improves the 99th percentile FCT for short flows by up to 94% compared to the state-of-the-art buffer management. We further show that ABM improves the performance of advanced datacenter transport protocols in terms of FCT by up to 76% compared to DCTCP, TIMELY and PowerTCP under bursty workloads even at moderate load conditions.","2022","2023-09-19 10:22:50","2023-09-19 10:22:50","","36–52","","","","","","","SIGCOMM '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","buffer management; datacenter; queue management; shared buffer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exploiting shared memory, L25GC eliminates message serialization and HTTP processing overheads, while being 3GPP-standards compliant. We improve data plane processing by factoring the functions to avoid control-data plane interference, and using scalable, flow-level packet classifiers for forwarding-rule lookups.

However, as we apply existing data plane verification techniques to large-scale networks, two problems appear due to extremes. First, existing techniques cannot handle too-fast arrivals, which we call update storms, when a large number of data plane updates must be processed in a short time. Second, existing techniques cannot handle well too-slow arrivals, which we call long-tail update arrivals, when the updates from a number of switches take a long time to arrive.This paper presents Flash, a novel system that achieves fast, consistent data plane verification when update arrivals can include update storms, long-tail update arrivals, or both. In particular, Flash introduces a novel technique called fast inverse model transformation to swiftly transform a large block of rule updates to a block of conflict-free updates to efficiently handle update storms. Flash also introduces consistent, efficient, early detection, a systematic mechanism and associated novel algorithms to detect data plane violations with incomplete information, to avoid being delayed by long-tail arrivals. We fully implement Flash and conduct extensive evaluations under various settings. Using the data plane of a large-scale network, we show that compared with state-of-the-art sequential per-update verification systems, Flash is 9,000x faster.","2022","2023-09-19 10:22:56","2023-09-19 10:22:56","","314–335","","","","","","","SIGCOMM '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","network monitoring; network reliability; network verification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, no single verifier can support all analyses that require different space coverage and failure models. This paper introduces Symbolic Router Execution (SRE), a general and scalable verification engine that supports various analyses. SRE symbolically executes the network model to discover what we call packet failure equivalence classes (PFECs), each of which characterises a unique forwarding behavior across the product space of headers and failures. SRE enables various optimizations during the symbolic execution, while remaining agnostic of the failure model, so it scales to the product space in a general way. By using BDDs to encode symbolic headers and failures, various analyses reduce to graph algorithms (e.g., shortest-path) on the BDDs. Our evaluation using real and synthetic topologies show SRE achieves better or comparable performance when checking reachability, mining specifications, etc. compared to state-of-the-art methods.","2022","2023-09-19 10:22:56","2023-09-19 10:22:56","","336–349","","","","","","","SIGCOMM '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","equivalence classes; network verification; symbolic execution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The core of Meissa is a domain-specific code summary technique that simplifies the control flow graph of a data plane program for scalable testing without sacrificing coverage.

Genet is built on curriculum learning, which has proved effective against similar issues in other RL applications. At a high level, curriculum learning gradually feeds more ""difficult"" environments to the training rather than choosing them uniformly at random. However, applying curriculum learning in networking is nontrivial since the ""difficulty"" of a network environment is unknown. Our insight is to leverage traditional rule-based (non-RL) baselines: If the current RL model performs significantly worse in a network environment than the rule-based baselines, then further training it in this environment tends to bring substantial improvement. Genet automatically searches for such environments and iteratively promotes them to training.

Many popular RTT monitoring techniques either send active probes (that do not capture application-level RTTs) or passively monitor only the TCP handshake (which can be inaccurate, especially for long-lived flows). High-speed programmable switches present a unique opportunity to monitor the RTTs continuously and react in real time to improve performance and security. In this paper, we present Dart, an inline, real-time, and continuous RTT measurement system that can enable automated detection of network events and adapt (e.g., routing, scheduling, marking, or dropping traffic) inside the network. However, designing Dart is fraught with challenges, due to the idiosyncrasies of the TCP protocol and the resource constraints in high-speed switches. Dart overcomes these challenges by strategically limiting the tracking of packets to only those that can generate useful RTT samples, and by identifying the synergy between per-flow state and per-packet state for efficient memory use. We present a P4 prototype of Dart for the Tofino switch, as well our experiments on a campus testbed and simulations using anonymized campus traces. Dart, running in real time and with limited data-plane memory, is able to collect 99% of the RTT samples of an offline, software baseline—a variant of the popular tcptrace tool that has access to unlimited memory.","2022","2023-09-19 10:22:59","2023-09-19 10:22:59","","473–485","","","","","","","SIGCOMM '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","highspeed programmable switch; network monitoring; passive measurement; round-trip time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to resource constraints, it is impossible to configure all needed tasks at start-up and dynamically turn on/of them. To support real-time reconfiguration of many different tasks, a key observation is that it is unnecessary to bind a task and its implementation at the compilation phase. We design FlyMon, the first sketch-based measurement system that can make on-the-fly reconfigurations on a large set of measurement tasks. FlyMon introduces the concept of Composable Measurement Units (CMUs), which are general operation units that support reconfigurable implementation for measurement tasks combined from different flow keys and flow attributes. FlyMon maps the design of CMUs to programmable switches' data planes so that the number of compacted CMUs can be maximized. FlyMon also provides dynamic memory management. We prototype FlyMon on Tofino and currently enable four frequently used flow attributes. Each CMU Group (with 3 CMUs) can concurrently perform up to 96 isolated measurement tasks with less than 8.3% hardware resources.

Therefore, existing approaches commonly employ differential binary modulation schemes, limiting the achievable data rates.

To provide such a ""life-like"" experience, (i) the VR headset (VRH) should be wireless so that the user can move around freely, and (ii) the wireless link, connecting the VRH to a high-performance renderer, should support high data rates (tens to hundreds of Gbps). Industry is already pushing towards such wireless VRHs; however, these wireless links can only support a few Gbps rates. In general, current radio-frequency (RF) links (including mmWave) are not able to provide desired data rates. In this paper, we build a system, we call Cyclops, which uses free-space optical (FSO) technology to create a high-bandwidth VR wireless link. FSO links are capable of very high data rates (up to Tbps) due to the high frequencies of light waves and narrow beams. The main challenges in developing an effective FSO link are: (i) designing a link with sufficient movement tolerance, and (ii) developing a viable tracking and pointing (TP) mechanism which maintains the link while the VRH moves. As traditional TP approaches seem infeasible in our context, we develop a novel TP approach based on learning techniques, leveraging the VRH's inbuilt tracking system. We build robust 10 Gbps and 25Gbps link prototypes from commodity components, demonstrate their viability for expected movement speeds of a VRH, and show that, with certain custom-built components, we can support much higher movement speeds and bandwidths.","2022","2023-09-19 10:23:01","2023-09-19 10:23:01","","601–614","","","","","","","SIGCOMM '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","free-space optics; tracking and pointing; virtual reality; wireless link","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the slow convergence (tens of milliseconds) of prior works can hardly satisfy the increasingly rigorous performance demand under dynamic traffic patterns. Further, state-of-the-art load balance schemes are all guarantee-agnostic and bring great risks on breaking bandwidth guarantee, which is overlooked in prior works.In this paper, we propose μFab, a predictable virtual fabric solution which can (1) explicitly select proper paths for all flows and (2) converge to ideal bandwidth allocation at sub-millisecond timescales. The core idea of μFab is to leverage the programmable data plane to build a fusion of an active edge (e.g., NIC) and an informative core (e.g., switch), where the core sends link status and tenant information to the edge via telemetry to help the latter make a timely and accurate decision on path selection and traffic admission. We fully implement μFab with commodity SmartNICs and programmable switches. Evaluations show that μFab can keep minimum bandwidth guarantee with high bandwidth utilization and near-optimal transmission latency in various network situations with limited probing bandwidth overhead.

To do so, we revisit Aggregate-based Congestion Control (ACC): a mechanism proposed two decades ago to manage congestion events caused by high-bandwidth traffic aggregates. While ACC proved efficient in inferring and controlling DDoS attacks, it cannot keep up with the speed requirements of pulse-wave attacks.We propose ACC-Turbo, a renewed version of ACC that infers attack patterns by applying online-clustering techniques in the network and mitigates them by leveraging programmable packet scheduling. By doing so, ACC-Turbo identifies attacks at line rate and in real-time, and rate-limits attack traffic on a per-packet basis.We fully implement ACC-Turbo in P4 and evaluate it on a wide range of attack scenarios. Our evaluation shows that ACC-Turbo autonomously identifies DDoS attack vectors in an unsupervised manner and rapidly mitigates pulse-wave DDoS attacks. We also show that ACC-Turbo runs on existing hardware (Intel Tofino).","2022","2023-09-19 10:23:03","2023-09-19 10:23:03","","693–706","","","","","","","SIGCOMM '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","ACC; aggregate-based congestion control; DDoS; network defenses; network security; programmable scheduling; pulse-wave DDoS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Algorithmic complexity attacks (ACAs) are a class of DoS attacks where an attacker uses a small amount of adversarial traffic to induce a large amount of work in the target system, pushing the system into overload and causing it to drop packets from innocent users. ACAs are particularly dangerous because, unlike volumetric DoS attacks, ACAs don't require a significant network bandwidth investment from the attacker Today, network functions (NFs) on the Internet must be designed and engineered on a case-by-case basis to mitigate the debilitating impact of ACAs. Further, the resulting designs tend to be overly conservative in their attack mitigation strategy, limiting the innocent traffic that the NF can serve under common-case operation.In this work, we propose a more general framework to make NFs resilient to ACAs. Our framework, SurgeProtector, uses the NF's scheduler to mitigate the impact of ACAs using a very traditional scheduling algorithm: Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF). To evaluate SurgeProtector, we propose a new metric of vulnerability called the Displacement Factor (DF), which quantifies the 'harm per unit effort' that an adversary can inflict on the system. We provide novel, adversarial analysis of WSJF and show that any system using this policy has a worst-case DF of only a small constant, where traditional schedulers place no upper bound on the DF. Illustrating that SurgeProtector is not only theoretically, but practically robust, we integrate SurgeProtector into an open source intrusion detection system (IDS). Under simulated attack, the SurgeProtector-augmented IDS suffers 90–99% lower innocent traffic loss than the original system.","2022","2023-09-19 10:23:03","2023-09-19 10:23:03","","723–738","","","","","","","SIGCOMM '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","adversarial scheduling; algorithmic complexity attacks; network security; pigasus; surgeprotector; WSJF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides the tremendous performance gains and CPU savings compared with the legacy kernel TCP stack, more importantly, it teaches us the necessity of offloading both network and storage into hardware and the importance of recovering instantaneously from network failures.Solar provides a highly reliable and performant storage network running on hardware. For avoiding hardware's resource limitations and offloading storage's entire data path, Solar eliminates the superfluous complexity and the overfull states from the traditional architecture of the storage network. The core design of Solar is unifying the concepts of network packet and storage data block - each network packet is a self-contained storage data block. There are three remarkable advantages to doing so. First, it merges the packet processing and storage virtualization pipelines to bypass the CPU and PCIe; Second, since the storage processes data blocks independently, the packets in Solar become independent. Therefore, the storage (in hardware) does not need to maintain receiving buffers for assembling packets into blocks or handling packet reordering. Finally, due to the low resource requirement and the resilience to packet reordering, Solar inherently supports large-scale multi-path transport for fast failure recovery. Facing the future, Solar demonstrates that we can formalize the storage virtualization procedure into a P4-compatible packet processing pipeline. Hence, SOLAR's design perfectly applies to commodity DPUs (data processing units).","2022","2023-09-19 10:23:04","2023-09-19 10:23:04","","753–766","","","","","","","SIGCOMM '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","data processing unit; in-network acceleration; storage network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, such serverless platforms lack dataplane optimizations to achieve efficient, high-performance function chains that facilitate the popular microservices development paradigm. Their use of unnecessarily complex and duplicate capabilities for building function chains severely degrades performance. 'Cold-start' latency is another deterrent.We describe SPRIGHT, a lightweight, high-performance, responsive serverless framework. SPRIGHT exploits shared memory processing and dramatically improves the scalability of the dataplane by avoiding unnecessary protocol processing and serialization-deserialization overheads. SPRIGHT extensively leverages event-driven processing with the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF). We creatively use eBPF's socket message mechanism to support shared memory processing, with overheads being strictly load-proportional. Compared to constantly-running, polling-based DPDK, SPRIGHT achieves the same dataplane performance with 10× less CPU usage under realistic workloads. Additionally, eBPF benefits SPRIGHT, by replacing heavyweight serverless components, allowing us to keep functions 'warm' with negligible penalty.Our preliminary experimental results show that SPRIGHT achieves an order of magnitude improvement in throughput and latency compared to Knative, while substantially reducing CPU usage, and obviates the need for 'cold-start'.","2022","2023-09-19 10:23:04","2023-09-19 10:23:04","","780–794","","","","","","","SIGCOMM '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","eBPF; event-driven; function chain; serverless","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially, in order to quantify how much information can be conveyed by wireless networks under node cascading failures, robust capacity is defined to capture the influence of the intensity of the initial failure nodes $m$ and the connectivity parameter $k$ on capacity. Note that increasing $k$ could provide $k$ disjoint data paths for any two nodes, thereby combating the cascading failure. Denoting the intensity of the nodes as $n$ and $m=n^{\frac{1}{\beta}}$, it is shown that robust capacity $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{k\log n}}\right)$ can be achieved when the initial failure exponent $\beta > 2$. In contrast, robust capacity would converge to zero with increasing $n$ when $1 < \beta\leq 2$ since the data paths of most source-destination pairs are interrupted due to the cascading failures. Moreover, increasing the connectivity parameter $k$, although capable of enhancing the network structure robustness, is shown to degrade cascading failures and robust capacity.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:23","2023-09-19 10:25:23","","6013-6018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a fully passive and low-cost solution based on pre-configured IRS to be lodged on the vehicle's body, which does not require any signaling for re-configuration. However, conventional IRS are planar array and cannot fit with most vehicles' silhouettes. Hence, the proposed design targets conformal surfaces (C-IRS) with an arbitrary shape. In particular, this paper reveals the first experimental findings on the realization of C-IRS operating at 26 GHz and measurements in anechoic chamber, which validate the analytical derivations. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed solution, numerical simulations in a V2V scenario show that, when the percentage of vehicles equipping a C-IRS increases, the communication becomes more robust to vehicle blockage and the average end-to-end SNR is enhanced up to 25 dB.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:23","2023-09-19 10:25:23","","6025-6030","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One general solution is to select a subset of network devices that can meet the traffic transmission requirements, thereby turning off the remaining redundant devices. However, modeling the problem as integer linear programming introduces significant time overhead, while heuristic approaches often suffer from poor generalizability. In this paper, we propose GreenDCN.ai, a closed-loop control system, which utilizes In-band Network Telemetry to collect the network-wide device-internal state, and leverages a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based energy-saving algorithm to make rapid decisions to turn on or off network device ports in response to the real-time network state. The trained GreenDCN.ai can adaptively adjust its energy-saving strategy without human intervention when the DCN topology changes. Besides, based on the regularity of the DCN topology, we design two training complexity reduction methods to address the non-convergence issue under large-scale DCN topologies. Specifically, we split the large-scale DCN topology into sub-topologies for parallel training on each sub-topology without breaking the DCN topology connectivity. Evaluation on software P4 switches suggests that GreenDCN.ai can achieve stable convergence within 590 episodes, generate effective action decisions within $\boldsymbol{79}\upmu\mathrm{s}$, and save about 34% to 39% of the network energy consumption.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:24","2023-09-19 10:25:24","","6055-6060","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it also brings unique security issues like voice replay attacks, where an attacker can generate a malicious voice command via a compromised playback device near the VAD. The usage of VADs in users' daily tasks makes such attack detection more important. To detect such attacks, we propose a defense system leveraging the impact of playback devices on the bass frequency region (0 to 500 Hz) of multi-channel audios. Currently, no prior work has exploited the playback device's impact on the bass frequency region of the multi-channel audios to prevent voice replay attacks. Specifically, our system divides the bass region of each channel into ten sub-bands and computes the total percentage of the overall signal's power presented in each sub-band. To make the system more robust against advanced audio attacks, we also extract the Modified Group Delay Function (MODGDF) cepstral coefficients of the bass area for phase features. Then, our proposed system applies a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to infer whether a human or a compromised playback device initiates the voice command. The system is then tested against a public multi-channel replay attack dataset. The system performance is checked in four different environmental conditions, achieving a maximum of 1.21 % Equal Error Rate (EER). Our experimental results also show that incorporating more audio channels improves the attack detection performance.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:26","2023-09-19 10:25:26","","6085-6090","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, although VoIP traffic is fully encrypted and secured, traffic analysis of this suppression can reveal identifying information about calls made to customer service automated phone systems. Because different customer service phone systems have distinct, but fixed (pre-recorded) automated voice messages sent to customers, VAD silence suppression used in VoIP will enable an eavesdropper to profile and identify these automated voice messages. In this paper, we will use a popular enterprise VoIP system (Cisco CallManager), running the default Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocol, to demonstrate that an attacker can reliably use the silence suppression to profile calls to such VoIP systems.

However, the complexity of DL libraries inevitably leads to multiple vulnerabilities. Recently, research on DL library testing generally designs a variety of mutation operators to generate new models from the perspective of model mutation. However, we find these research efforts do not consider that different mutation operators have different vulnerability mining efficiencies, thus treating all mutation operators equally can lead to inefficiency. Based on the above observation, we design a novel mutation operator scheduling strategy to improve the efficiency of vulnerability mining in the DL library, including the multi-staged mutation operator selection strategy and mutation operator energy allocation strategy. To evaluate the efficiency of our work, we implement a prototype called MMOS. The results show that MMOS finds six more crash bugs, two more NaN bugs and one more inconsistency bug in four widely used DL libraries including TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK and MXNet compared with the random strategy. Among them, MMOS finds 5 previously unknown vulnerabilities in MXNet and 1 in CNTK. Moreover, MMOS outperforms LEMON in vulnerability mining of DL libraries.

The CoS classification is advantageous in resource scheduling for Internet service providers and avoids the necessity of remodelling. Our goal is to find a robust, lightweight, and fast-converging CoS classifier that uses fewer data in modelling and does not require specialized tools in feature extraction. The commonality of statistical features among the network flow segments motivates us to propose novel segmented learning that includes essential vector representation and a simple-segment method of classification. We represent the segmented traffic in the vector form using the essential vector representation (EVR). Then, the segmented traffic is modelled for classification using random forest based simple-segment method of classification (S2MC). Our solution's success relies on finding the optimal segment size and a minimum number of segments required in modelling. The solution is validated on multiple datasets for various CoS services, including virtual reality (VR). Significant findings of the research work are i) Synchronous services that require acknowledgment and request to continue communication are classified with 99 % accuracy, ii) Initial 1,000 packets in any session are good enough to model a CoS traffic for promising results, and we therefore can quickly deploy a CoS classifier, and iii) Test results remain consistent even when trained on one dataset and tested on a different dataset.

Due to the difficulties of OWD measurement (need to control both ends and synchronize their clocks), now RTT/2 is commonly used to estimate OWD. However, OWD asymmetry can lead to large errors in the halving RTT method, which in turn affects the end-to-end quality of service (QoS) guarantees. In this paper, we investigate OWD asymmetry through large-scale OWD measurements on a global scale. The measurements show that more than 11% of network paths have OWDs with a relative difference of more than 10% compared to RTT/2. By analyzing the measurement results in depth, we try to explain why the delay asymmetry occurs. We find that 67% is caused by hop inflation or a significant increase in propagation distance, and 33% is caused by variable queuing delays. We also find AS-level paths between node pairs with significant delay asymmetry are much more likely (~ 10 ×) to violate the well-known valley-free rule.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:28","2023-09-19 10:25:28","","6127-6132","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These metrics depend on the sum of computation and network latency needed to generate and deliver a video frame to the Head-Mounted Display (HMD) and the power consumption on the HMD. Recent research shows that Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) can support mobile HMDs to reduce their computing latency, but its potential to maintain the acceptable end-to-end (E2E) latency and reduce power consumption under high mobility conditions remains unexplored. This paper proposes Service Chaining Graph (SCG), an orchestrator to split VR applications into atomic services and deploy them across HMDs and MEC servers according to an optimization problem that aims to jointly minimize latency and energy consumption. Through simulations, we show that SCG reduces E2E latency by up to 74% in three high-mobility user-dense scenarios compared to four widely used service-migration strategies against a moderate increase in power consumption. Unlike other approaches, SCG can find a balance between average latency and energy consumption by migrating services between MEC servers and HMDs according to a policy depending on application requirements.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:28","2023-09-19 10:25:28","","6133-6138","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For enabling delivery of high data rate video content in real-time, the supporting wireless networks will leverage highly directional communication links that will “track” the users for maintaining the Line-of-Sight (LoS) connectivity. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have historically presented themselves as a suitable candidate for near-term movement trajectory prediction for natural human mobility, and have also recently been shown as applicable in predicting VR users' mobility under the constraints of redirected walking. In this work, we extend these initial findings by showing that Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, another candidate from the RNN family, generally outperform the traditionally utilized LSTMs. Second, we show that context from a virtual world can enhance the accuracy of the prediction if used as an additional input feature in comparison to the more traditional utilization of solely the historical physical movements of the VR users. Finally, we show that the prediction system trained on a static number of coexisting VR users be scaled to a multi-user system without significant accuracy degradation.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:28","2023-09-19 10:25:28","","6139-6145","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By reconstructing high-resolution frames from low-resolution frames that have been downloaded, both high video quality and a short rebuffer time can be enjoyed. However, the exiting methods merely leverage the computing resources of the edge server or mobile device, leaving significant room for further QoE improvement. In this paper, we present an adaptive Video Streaming system with Edge-Client collaborative Super-resolution, named VSECS, to enhance users' QoE by simultaneously utilizing the computing resources of both the edge server and mobile device to reconstruct high-resolution frames collaboratively. First, we deploy a large-scale super-resolution model on the edge server and a lightweight model on the mobile device. Then, we exploit the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to make decisions regarding the download resolution, the reconstructed target resolution, and the workload share of the mobile device, considering the network bandwidth, computing resources, and reconstruction complexity of video tiles.

In a joint detection and decoding framework, this work demonstrates how GRAND can leverage crude soft information in received symbols and channel state information to generate, through guesswork, soft bit reliability outputs in log-likelihood ratios (LLRs). The LLRs are generated via successive computations of Euclidean-distance metrics corresponding to candidate noise-recovered words. Noting that the entropy of noise is much smaller than that of information bits, a small number of noise effect guesses generally suffices to hit a code-word, which allows generating LLRs for critical bits; LLR saturation is applied to the remaining bits. In an iterative (turbo) mode, the generated LLRs at a given soft-input, soft-output GRAND iteration serve as enhanced a priori information that adapts noise-sequence guess ordering in a subsequent iteration. Simulations demonstrate that a few turbo-GRAND iterations match the performance of ML-detection-based soft-GRAND in both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels at a complexity cost that, on average, grows linearly (instead of exponentially) with the number of symbols.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:30","2023-09-19 10:25:30","","6182-6187","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in practice, the difference between the two channels in terms of noise may be much smaller because of the wide spread application of high-performance communication technologies. Thus, establishing a wiretap channel over real channels is a challenging task. In this paper, we report a wiretap channel in the form of a “protocol” (a so-called virtual wiretap channel) realized by using a highly precise wireless clock-synchronization technology called the wireless two-way interferometry (abbreviated as Wi-Wi). Wi-Wi technology has already been implemented in wireless communication devices, and it measures the clock time difference and signal propagation time in a situation where the precisions of both values are mutually affected. That is, Alice or Bob can induce a noise on Eve's clock time difference measurement by physically introducing noise in the signal propagation time between Alice and Bob. We analyzed the proposed wiretap channel referred to as the Wi-Wi wiretap channel experimentally, and estimated its parameters (e.g., the error probabilities). We confirmed that the Wi-Wi wiretap channel works well as a virtual wiretap channel by simulating and experimentally demonstrating a well-known, provably secure, optimal wiretap code over it. The results show that Wi-Wi wiretap channel can serve as a physical layer security, useful for synchronized Internet of Things (IoT) devises.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:30","2023-09-19 10:25:30","","6188-6193","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To mitigate the destructive effects of NLoS connections, we target development of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) anchor selection framework that can efficiently cope with the dynamic nature of indoor environments. Existing RL models in this context, however, lack the ability to generalize well to be used in a new setting. Moreover, it takes a long time for the conventional RL models to reach the optimal policy. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Jump-start RL-based Uwb NOde selection (JUNO) framework, which performs real-time location predictions without relying on complex NLoS identification/mitigation methods. The effectiveness of the proposed JUNO framework is evaluated in term of the location error, where the mobile user moves randomly through an ultra-dense indoor environment with a high chance of establishing NLoS connections.

In the IoUT, sensors may be deployed individually on sea surface and seabed as well as in water at different depths. They also may be integrated into underwater items such as fish, plants, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), and divers. Depending on the application, different connectivity requirements must be satisfied such as data rate, latency, and reliability. However, the underwater communication channels pose a significant challenge to meet these requirements. To accommodate various applications with different service level agreements (SLAs), a multimode (acoustic, optical, and magnetic induction (MI)) communication system is proposed to take advantage of the modes' complementary features. Furthermore, an automatic network slicing (ANS) solution is proposed to provide globally optimized resource management, enhanced quality of service (QoS), simplified network operation, reduced deployment cost, and functional isolation of services. Taking the channel characteristics of the acoustic, optical, and MI communication modes into consideration, an optimization problem is formulated and solved for multimode IoUT (MM-IoUT) to enable admission control, routing, and dynamic resource allocation based on the different SLAs. Numerical analysis is conducted to verify the proposed solution and evaluate its performance.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:32","2023-09-19 10:25:32","","6241-6246","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a trust-based method to optimize the network throughput of IoTs under DDOS attacks. Specifically, with the assistance of a small number of dedicatedly deployed defense nodes as defenders, a network controller can first measure the behavior of other IoT nodes and categorize them into three types (i.e., innocent, selfish, and attack) through a well-designed trust evaluation model. Then, a Stackelberg game model is constructed accordingly, where defenders are leaders and other nodes are followers. We carefully define the utilities of the leaders and the followers in the game, and transform the optimization problem of the network throughput into the maximization problem of the defenders' utilities considering the utilities of the followers. We adopt the Dinkelbach Programming (DP)-based algorithm to solve the maximization problem such that a Stackelberg equilibrium can be reached with optimized network throughput.

We first model the source statuses monitored by sensors as Markov chains and the scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Due to the heterogeneity of source statuses in IIoT, it is prohibitive to solve the formulated MDP problem by conventional methods. To this end, we make use of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to solve this scheduling problem. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of the adopted DRL algorithm.

This paper presents a federated matching framework for heterogeneous IoT networks in which an intermediate layer of multi-protocol mobile gateways (M-MGs) is deployed by different service providers (SPs) to collect and relay data from IoT objects and perform computing tasks. The aim is to develop collaborative strategies between M-MGs and SPs to minimize the average weighted sum of the age-of-information and energy consumption. A novel collaborative framework based on a 2-level multi-protocol multi-agent actor-critic (MP-MAAC) is presented, where M-MGs and SPs can learn the interactive strategies through their own observations. The M-MGs strategies include the selection of IoT objects for data collection, execution, and offloading t o S Ps' a ccess points while SPs decide on the spectrum allocation. Moreover, we incorporate federated matching (Fed-Match) into the multi-agent collaborative framework to improve the convergence of the learning process.

In this paper, we design a cost-effective data offloading mechanism for vehicles in ISTN. The default transmission for remote areas is via the satellite, where the terrestrial networks can offload the data with intermittent coverage in an opportunistic manner due to the vehicle mobility. To model the diversity in service delay requirements, a virtual queue is exploited to capture the residual maximum delay tolerance of each service as time elapses.

The age of information (AoI) is widely used to capture the timeliness. We pay attention to the age outage, which is defined as the probability that the peak age exceeds a certain threshold.

An interesting result is that long delay and channel unreliability has the potential to decrease the age outage probability. To improve age outage, we further propose a local-assisted joint control policy by introducing the smart sensor that is capable of processing and controlling.

For the sampling in Sel-INT, there is a tradeoff between bandwidth overheads and monitoring accuracy, which can be adjusted by the sampling ratio. In this paper, we investigate how to adjust the sampling ratio of Sel-INT adaptively such that the tradeoff can be balanced precisely. We first develop a theoretical model to analyze the accuracy of Sel-INT for traffic trace reconstruction under different sampling ratios. We assume that the data samples of a flow's traffic trace (i.e., bandwidth usage) follow the Gaussian random process, and the traffic trace is reconstructed with linear interpolation based on the samples collected by Sel-INT. We analyze this process theoretically and derive the expected reconstruction error (RCE) between the original and reconstructed traces. Then, we use RCE to determine whether the sampling ratio of Sel-INT is properly set and propose two algorithms, namely, RCESA and pRCESA, to adjust the sampling ratio adaptively.

Existing traffic envelopes typically satisfy at most two of these properties. A well-known traffic envelope based on the moment generating function (MGF) of the arrival process satisfies only the third property. We propose a new traffic envelope based on the MGF of the workload process obtained from offering the traffic to a constant service rate queue.

In this paper, we present HashCuckoo, an approach to predict elephant flows that includes: (i) a hash-based mechanism to start the prediction process at line rate in P4 switches, based on the Cuckoo Search meta-heuristic; and (ii) a local prediction mechanism to infer the new flows' traffic behavior, confirming the classification, and handling elephant flows on-line before exceeding traditionally considered thresholds. We evaluate the trade-offs between HashCuckoo and state-of-the-art solutions, and show that HashCuckoo reduces elephant flow identification delay by 57%, from 102 ms to 43 ms, being the first solution to combine meta-heuristic optimization and prediction that can operate at line rate in programmable data planes.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:36","2023-09-19 10:25:36","","6337-6342","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop an efficient online algorithm that circumvents various limitations of existing P4-programmable data plane devices and performs the DWT decomposition entirely in the data plane. Our evaluation of a hardware implementation (i.e., Netronome NFP-4000 SmartNIC) of the algorithm shows that it results in only minimal throughput overhead (less than 1% for average-sized packets) and operates within constraints imposed by the limited available data plane resources. As an application, we use our lightweight P4 implementation of the DWT and describe a novel threshold-based approach for detecting periodic behavior in a signal in real-time, at line rate in the data plane (40 Gbps).

First, the containerized hardware usage of deployed containers is continuously monitored in a non-intrusive manner, leveraging the container engine resource management interface.

Experiments run on a containerized Apache Spark distribution have shown that multi-tenancy and hardware over-commitment significantly affect its performance.

However, computing and network-intensive utilization of resources require changes in cloud-based and traditional monolithic (single machine) deployments towards distributed edge computing architecture to enable high-quality interaction. Decomposing MUVR into elements with specialized Service Functions (SF) in order and organizing it into a Service Function Chaining (SFC) requests orchestration enables MUVR to reuse frame processing between users and improves MUVR scalability. However, orchestrating distributed edge computing resources and multiple destination SFCs while minimizing delay and meeting resource requirements is a challenging task. This article proposes a multi-criteria SFC orchestration scheme for MUVR services, called MuSFiCO. MuSFiCO maps edge computing resources and instantiates SFCs on distributed servers based on delays threshold, CPU and memory resources, and bandwidth. We developed a constrained-based heuristic to minimize delay and compare it with the baseline monolithic deployment and cloud-based SFC algorithms.

However, the advantages of TL come with computation and communication costs. Therefore, the decision to transfer knowledge between learners should be optimized while at the same time avoiding negative transfer (NT), i.e. when the source information does not improve but rather degrades the learning performance in the target. In this paper, we propose a new notion namely, regret of learner (RoL) as a quantitative measure for the learner's performance, computation costs and communication resources of TL. Then, we use a convex combination of the empirical source and target errors with respect to the feasibility and resource constraints to design an optimization model called OPTL that deploys a TL model in a resource-constrained environment to avoid NT. This model can be employed as a general framework for different ML methods and various communication scenarios and use cases by changing the unification parameters. To validate our approach, we use OPTL for optimized TL in a deep learning (DL)-based classification problem.

In this paper, we focus on distributing training, one of the core tasks, that is carried out by an edge server of limited communication capacity and multiple end devices. In distributed training, the key issue for the edge server is how to dynamically select a proper subset of end devices to periodically participate in the training. Such a dynamic end device selection problem is hindered by concerns like 1) unknown system dynamics, e.g., transmission latencies; 2) limited energy resources on end devices; and 3) unbalanced and non-IID data distribution over end devices. Therefore, the core challenge lies in the coordination of online learning and online control to fulfill both efficient learning of unknown statistics and guarantees of within-budget energy consumption and fairness selection. To address the above challenge, we first characterize the social ties among users of end devices as a social graph and then formulate the dynamic end device selection problem from the perspective of constrained graphical bandits. Under the formulation, we propose GRIND to effectively integrate graphical bandit learning methods with Lyapunov-drift techniques. The theoretical superiority of GRIND is not only 1) the achieved sub-linear round-averaged regret with satisfied long-term constraints but also 2) the characterization of graph structure with the independence number. Extensive simulations also verify the effectiveness of GRIND in terms of both latency reduction and long-term constraint satisfaction.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:38","2023-09-19 10:25:38","","6372-6377","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The latter especially affects the uplink traffic, which will grow in 6G and beyond networks, calling for new optimization metrics that include energy, service delay, and electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure (EMFE). To this end, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising solution to mitigate the EMFE, thanks to their ability of shaping and manipulating the impinging electromagnetic waves. In line with this vision, this paper proposes an online adaptive method to mitigate the EMFE under end-to-end delay constraints of a computation offloading service, in the context of RIS and multi-access edge computing (ME C)-aided wireless networks. The goal is to minimize the long-term average of the EMF human exposure under such constraints, investigating the advantages of RISs towards blue (i.e. low EMFE) communications. A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is investigated as part of the visions towards 6G. Focusing on a typical scenario of computation offloading, the method jointly and adaptively optimizes user precoding, transmit power, RIS reflectivity parameters, and receiver combiner, with theoretical guarantees on the desired long-term performance. Besides the theoretical results, numerical simulations assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, when exploiting accurate antenna patterns, thus showing the advantage of the RIS and that of our method, compared to benchmark solutions.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:39","2023-09-19 10:25:39","","6396-6401","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One immediate application is the multicast scenario, where one multi-antenna transmitter wishes to send private information to multiple legitimate users with the aid of an RIS. To concurrently maximize the data rate of legitimate users and minimize information leakage to eavesdroppers, the active beamformer at the sender and the passive beamformer at the RIS need to be jointly designed.

To this end, we propose a joint space-frequency anti-jamming scheme. Considering the broadband response of the Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), we innovatively exploit different spatial and frequency responses of the RIS to generate space-frequency filtering during the propagation of the jamming signal. We formulate a problem to design reflection coefficients of the RIS so the jamming signals will be attenuated, but the legitimate signal will be enhanced at the receiver. Then the problem is equiv-alently transformed into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem which can be efficiently solved. We also present a jamming suppression scheme when legitimate transmitter pilots are submerged. Simulation results show that the proposed joint space-frequency anti-jamming scheme consti-tutes an equivalent broadband band-stop filter to the jamming signal and has better resistance to strong jamming. Meanwhile, the anti-jamming ability will further increase with the number of RIS elements. As an equivalent space-frequency filter embedded in the wireless environment, the proposed scheme introduces a different filtering paradigm to collaborate with existing anti-jamming techniques effectively and reveal its potential in some military or civilian scenarios.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:39","2023-09-19 10:25:39","","6408-6414","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many OSNs such as Facebook, Twitter provide resharing or reposting features, which allows users to share others' content with their own friends or followers. As content is shared from person to person, cascades of information-sharing can occur. There are many existing works focusing on analyzing and characterizing the cascades in OSNs. However, previous works focus on the analysis and characterization of cascades without providing a solution to accurately predict cascades. Although some methods for cascade prediction have been proposed recently, their methods work in social networks such as Facebook (or Twitter), and do not work well simultaneously in multiple OSNs such as Software Social Network (SSN) GitHub, Twitter and Reddit because GitHub, Twitter and Reddit have different social activity patterns.

By preprocessing flow records, segmenting traffic flows into bursts, and leveraging a long short-term memory network to classify the bursts, our approach can identify major OSN behaviors (e.g., Facebook post, Twitter Read, Weibo video, etc.) with nearly 90% accuracy. Compared with packet-level fingerprinting approaches, our approach significantly improves the fingerprinting efficiency in evaluations, making large-scale OSN usage monitoring feasible only with limited computing resources and coarse-grained network traffic.

Regarding constraint on the maximum number of illuminated beams per time slot, the technical requirement is formulated as a sparse optimization problem in which the hardware-related beam illumination energy is modeled in a sparsity form of the LP vectors. To cope with this problem, the compressed sensing method is employed to transform the sparsity parts into the quadratic form of pre-coders. Then, an iterative window-based algorithm is developed to update the LP vectors sequentially to an efficient solution. Additionally, two other two-phase frameworks are also proposed for comparison purposes. In the first phase, these methods aim to determine the MODCOD transmission schemes for users to meet their demands by using a heuristic approach or DNN tool. In the second phase, the LP vectors of each time slot will be optimized separately based on the determined MODCOD schemes.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:41","2023-09-19 10:25:41","","6445-6450","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing indoor localization and tracking methods based on RFID do not perform well in dynamic environments with severe multi-path interference. In this paper, we propose a robust Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation method for mobile RFID tags in a rich multi-path environment with a large feasible area. The proposed method Tri-AoA consists of three essential modules, phase likelihood estimation, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) likelihood estimation and a deep learning algorithm. The phase likelihood estimation module exploits the concept of an antenna array to provide a basic estimation of an AoA, but with an ambiguity. The RSSI likelihood estimation module helps alleviate the ambiguity. To achieve a more robust estimation of AoA for mobile RFID tags, we construct a 2-dimensional feature image that contains AoA estimation from the phase and RSSI modules. We then develop a deep learning algorithm to analyze this image to improve the AoA tracking accuracy as well as the robustness by suppressing the multi-path interference. The experimental results show that our system outperforms existing approaches by achieving a median error of $2.36^{\mathrm{o}}$ in a $3m\times 4m$ area using four COTS RFID antennas. We also show that our system can realize real-time performance on a personal computer.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:41","2023-09-19 10:25:41","","6451-6456","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the deployment of RISs with a large dimension, near-field (NF) scenarios are likely to occur, especially for indoor applications, and are the focus of this work. We first derive the Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the estimation error of the RIS position and orientation and the time of arrival (TOA) for the path transmitter-RIS-receiver. We propose a multi-stage low-complexity estimator for RIS localization purposes. In this proposed estimator, we first perform a line search to estimate the TOA. Then, we use the far-field approximation of the NF signal model to implicitly estimate the angle of arrival and the angle of departure at the RIS center. Finally, the RIS position and orientation estimate are refined via a quasi-Newton method. Simulation results reveal that the proposed estimator can attain the CRBs.

The ever-growing number of UAV brings challenges for air traffic control (ATC), and thus trajectory prediction plays a vital role in ATC, especially for avoiding collisions among UAVs. However, the dynamic flight of UAV aggravates the complexity of trajectory prediction. Different with civil aviation aircrafts, the most intractable difficulty for UAV trajectory prediction depends on acquiring effective location information. Fortunately, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) is an effective technique to help obtain positioning information. It is widely used in the civil aviation aircraft, due to its high data update frequency and low cost of corresponding ground stations construction. Hence, in this work, we consider leveraging ADS-B to help UAV trajectory prediction. However, with the ADS-B information for a UAV, it still lacks efficient mechanism to predict the UAV trajectory. It is noted that the recurrent neural network (RNN) is available for the UAV trajectory prediction, in which the long short-term memory (LSTM) is specialized in dealing with the time-series data. As above, in this work, we design a system of UAV trajectory prediction with the ADS-B information, and propose the recurrent LSTM (RLSTM) based algorithm to achieve the accurate prediction. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted by Python to evaluate the proposed algorithms, and the results show that the average trajectory prediction error is satisfied, which is in line with expectations.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:42","2023-09-19 10:25:42","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, limited wireless resources become the bottleneck of large-scale multi-agent cooperation. Therefore, we focus on how to improve the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning under the constraint of communication resources. To share more valuable information among agents under resource constraint, we formulate the message importance and design a decentralized scheduling policy with query mechanism, so that agents can effectively exchange messages according to their message importance. We further design a message prediction mechanism to compensate for those messages that are not scheduled for transmission in the current round. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes in a traffic junction environment, where only a fraction of agents can broadcast their messages in each round due to limited wireless resources. Results show that the importance-aware message exchange can extract valuable information to guarantee the system performance even when less than half of agents can share their states. By exploiting message prediction, the system can further save 40% of communication resources while guaranteeing the system performance.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:43","2023-09-19 10:25:43","","6493-6498","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, facing the challenges of the rapidly increasing users' demand for multimedia content, how to achieve efficient data delivery in a dynamic environment becomes a critical but knotty problem. To provide an efficient solution from the routing perspective, in this paper, we consider the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architecture and propose a content-aware routing scheme. The basic idea of the proposed routing scheme is to leverage the cached content on cache-enabled satellites and find the optimal route solution with maximum net-gains, i.e., how much delay is reduced. Considering the limitation of periodical signaling collection in satellite networks, we also design a cached content prediction model, which can infer the probability that a certain content could be cached according to the content's historical popularity information, to provide necessary information to measure net-gains. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed content-aware routing scheme outperforms the traditional routing scheme with a 20% reduction in terms of content retrieval delay and traffic consumption.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:45","2023-09-19 10:25:45","","6541-6546","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under this system, we derive closed-form average Age of Information (AoI) expressions for reactive HARQ and proactive HARQ, respectively.

Through case studies and analytical results, we provide comparative insights between reactive HARQ and proactive HARQ from the perspective of freshness of information. The numerical results and optimization solutions reveal that proactive HARQ draws its strength from both superior age performance and system robustness, thus enabling the potential to provide new system advancement for a freshness-critical status update system.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown its huge potential in wireless scenarios where parameter learning is required given the dynamic nature of such context.

However, it is difficult to meet the stringent delay demand of massive connectivity with existing grant-based (GB) random access and fixed frame structure in long-term evolution (LTE) and the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) systems. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose the new grant-free (GF) based adaptive blocklength scheme for short packet transmission to reduce the access delay. We develop the adaptive blocklength framework where the blocklength can be adaptively changed according to the real-time load, to revise the traditional non-flexible frame structure which impacts the delay performance. Taking the features of mURLLC into consideration, we analyze the GF random access procedure, packet arrival behavior, packet collision, and packet transmission error in the finite blocklength (FB) regime. On this basis, we derive the closed-form expression of successful access and transmission probability and give the GF-based status update model. Then, we propose the access delay minimization problem that jointly considers queuing delay and transmission delay to reduce the overall access delay. With the alternating optimization algorithm, we obtain the optimal blocklength of each packet, thus forming the corresponding adaptive blocklength scheme for mURLLC. Simulation results verify the correctness of theoretical results and show that our proposed adaptive blocklength scheme can significantly reduce the access delay compared with that of LTE and 5G NR systems.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:25:46","2023-09-19 10:25:46","","6559-6564","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such potential enhancement, however, relies on an efficient positioning of the FlyBSs as well as a management of resources. In this paper, we study the problem of sum capacity maximization in an extended model for mobile networks where multiple FlyBSs are deployed between the ground base station and the users. Due to an inclusion of multiple hops, the existing solutions for two-hop networks cannot be applied due to the incurred backhaul constraints for each hop. To this end, we propose an analytical approach based on an alternating optimization of the FlyBSs' 3D positions as well as the association of the users to the FlyBSs over time. The proposed optimization is provided under practical constraints on the FlyBS's flying speed and altitude as well as the constraints on the achievable capacity at the backhaul link.

In order to maximize the throughput of RIS-aided mmWave systems, acquisition of accurate downlink channel information at the base station (BS) is crucial. However, since the BS needs to acquire not only the conventional direct channel between the BS and user but also the channels reflected by RIS (i.e., BS to RIS and RIS to user channels), the pilot overhead is proportional to the number of RIS reflecting elements. In this paper, we propose an efficient channel estimation framework reducing the pilot overhead of RIS-aided mmWave systems. Key idea of proposed scheme is to decompose the RIS-aided channel into three major components, i.e., static BS- RIS angles, quasi-static RIS-user angles, and time-varying BS-RIS-user path gains, and then estimate them in different time scales. In doing so, the number of channel parameters to be estimated at each stage can be reduced significantly.

The conventional maximum biased received power criterion, where the bias is used for mm-wave small-cells, is adopted for cell associations. By varying the value of the bias factor, we investigate the changes in the downlink rate coverage probability. Our simulation results indicate that high values (of the order of 30 dB) for the bias, while beneficial in the case of perfect alignment, are actually disadvantageous for the low-rate users in the case of imperfect beam alignment. The low-rate users are better served by a moderate value (of the order of 20 dB) of the bias when the beam alignment errors are accounted for.

In this paper, stochastic geometry tools are utilized to capture the effect of a reference receiver's gain at azimuthal angle $\phi$, on the performance of a mmWave network. Accordingly, performance analysis in terms of coverage probability is conducted under three interference scenarios: i) a worst-case dominant interference scenario, in which the dominant interfering base station (BS) is the BS that is both the nearest in azimuthal angle, $\phi$, measured from the direction of the serving BS, and the second nearest in Euclidean distance, $r$, from the receiver, ii) a dominant interference scenario, in which the dominant interferer is the nearest BS in azimuthal angle, $n$, and uniformly distributed in an annulus formed by the the serving distance and a ball radius $R$, and iii) the aggregate interference scenario. By defining the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the three interference scenarios, the coverage probability is derived in exact form.

We introduce a cost framework to determine how frequently such reconfigurations should occur in order to optimally trade off between the cost of the reconfiguration (or context switching) overhead and the latency cost due to the delayed reconfiguration. A general framing algorithm is introduced to optimize dynamic processor allocation that limits processors to only be reallocated at the beginning of a new frame, but allows a class of functions of the historical backlog to be employed when selecting the new allocation.

However, as medical data often involves sensitive personal data, privacy concerns have become a significant impediment to the development of eHealthcare. Although several privacy-preserving skyline query schemes in eHealthcare have been put forth, they need a trusted platform to generate and assign secret keys for the multi-source scenario. In addition, those schemes incur non-trivial computational costs on resource-limited entities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel privacy-preserving skyline query scheme, named PPsky, based on arithmetic secret sharing, in which a series of secure protocols are designed to handle the basic operations in skyline queries. Security analysis illustrates that our PPsky scheme is privacy-preserving, and the evaluation results also validate the efficiency of our PPsky scheme.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:19","2023-09-19 10:27:19","","5469-5474","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their elevated encryption time and memory access, due to the number of scannings needed to cipher an image, have been an issue for chaotic ciphers. Considering this, a new cipher is proposed in this work in which the plain-image is divided into blocks and a simultaneous permutation-diffusion is adopted, increasing the cipher's time efficiency. The cipher is executed in a Raspberry Pi 3 device, and it presents a significant increase in throughput compared to other similar works in literature. Additionally, extensive security evaluations showed that the cipher is secure relative to statistical, differential, chosen-plaintext, brute force, noise, and occlusion attacks, which are hence suitable for the application in real-time IoT applications.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:20","2023-09-19 10:27:20","","5481-5486","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the high dynamics of the PEC environment, it is very challenging to achieve efficient service access control of edge servers and users without an “always-online” centralized server. In this paper, we propose a secure, efficient, and distributed service access control frame-work (SE-DAC) in the PEC environment. Specifically, SE-DAC extends the key-aggregate cryptosystem to achieve batch service authorization, where the service provider aggregates the access keys of different services to produce a constant-size aggregate key for the edge servers. Meanwhile, user authentication tasks are delegated to the edge servers by integrating secret sharing. The mutual authentication between the edge servers and the users is based on zero-round trip communication, such that the communication bandwidth cost is low. In addition, the service provider can efficiently revoke the authorization of the dropout or compromised edge servers in response to the dynamics of the PEC environment. Finally, we conduct numerical analysis and experiments to demonstrate that SE-DAC is highly computational efficient on service authorization, authentication, and revocation.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:20","2023-09-19 10:27:20","","5487-5492","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With this proximate placement and service provisioning, migration of a service from one edge enabled gNodeB (gNB) to another is intrinsic to maintain the service continuity. Since such services are migrated through the channel shared between the gNBs, proper security measures should be inhibited by the communication protocol to prevent any unauthorized interception. Further, each gNB should ensure the legitimacy of the migrating gNBs to avoid any impersonation attempts. As this is an area that lacks focus in current research trends, this paper introduces MEC Service Migration Authentication Protocol (MEC-SMAP), a protocol that take place prior to the migration initiation, and specifically defined for MEC. The proposed protocol ensures the secure transfer of session key generation parameters to form a secure channel while ensuring perfect forward secrecy. It introduces an identity verification mechanism through a trusted third party service. We have validated the proposed protocol through formal analysis using GNY logic and Scyther tool.

Unlike the conventional perfect channel state information (CSI) assumption, the estimation error of LUs' azimuths is assumed, which corresponds to a more practical scenario. Moreover, the influence of the imperfect CSI on the design of artificial noise (AN) vector is investigated.

In this paper, an AN suppression model under single-input multi-output (SIMO) systems is presented, and the impact of imperfect frequency synchronization on the AN suppressed performance is analyzed. Specifically, we first analyze the AN suppression performance of single branch with imperfect frequency synchronization. Then the output signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) after multi-branch merging is derived. Finally, the secrecy capacity of AN based on SIMO systems is extracted on the basis of the obtained SINR. Theoretical and simulation results show that imperfect frequency synchronization reduces the SINR of each branch, and thus degrades both the output SINR and secrecy capacity in SIMO systems.

Owing to its relatively limited processing power and bandwidth, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks may cause substan-tial damage. Moreover, the complexity and difficulty of defense also increase due to the constantly changing topology scale of SI when supporting various applications. Therefore, path tracking must be maintained with high precision at different scales to realize protection at the boundary. However, the marking rate limits traditional packet marking methods, causing a decrease in the tracking accuracy when the topology is expanded. Therefore, we propose a scalable traffic path tracking (TPT) scheme. Firstly, a lightweight description of malicious traffic in the entire network is realized by improving a multi-dimensional traffic feature digesting method. Secondly, the connection relationship sparse matrix of nodes is obtained based on the Hidden Markov Model modeling of the network topology and attack scenarios. These generate the observation probability matrix B and transition probability matrix A of the traditional Viterbi algorithm. Finally, we optimize the Viterbi algorithm by adding an index matrix of the next-largest probability value to eliminate tracking loops, thereby achieving high tracking accuracy for topologies of different scales. The Keysight Ixia platform is used to generate malicious traffic in the experiments. The results demonstrate that the scheme can maintain a tracking accuracy of over 99 % against various DDoS attacks in topologies of different scales, which is more accurate and scalable than existing methods.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:21","2023-09-19 10:27:21","","5522-5527","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we study how the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic affects the correlation of interference, in which the spatial correlation of traffic is captured by using Poisson cluster process (PCP) to characterize the spatial attraction, while the temporal correlation is described by correlated arrival and process of packets. The closed-form expressions to quantitatively describe the interference correlation caused by spatio-temporal correlated traffic are derived. Our results reveal that the spatial aggregation of traffic leads to an increase in interference correlation compared with spatially independent traffic. If the traffic is temporally independent, the interference correlation decreases with the increase of the distance between two receivers or the cluster size. For temporally intra-correlated traffic, when increasing the transmission probability, the interference correlation first increases and then decreases when increasing the cluster size.

Because network reliability evaluation is a computationally heavy task, past research has relied on unre-alistically simple failure models such as the independent failure model, wherein each link fails stochastically and independently, ignoring large-scale failures such as disasters, or the deterministic-correlated failure model, wherein all links within a disaster area always fail. However, actual networks follow the probabilistic-correlated (PC) failure model, wherein links in a disaster area fail stochastically with respect to each disaster. This paper proposes an efficient method to accurately compute network reliability under the PC model. Following a conventional method for the independent model, the proposed method uses binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to efficiently handle an exponential number of failure states. Additionally, it employs a probabilistic inference technique to support probabilistic correlation, which is represented as another BDD for integration with the conventional method.

Numerical results show the proposed scheme can meet the communication requirements of UAV and reduce the UAV's unintentional interference at the same time.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:23","2023-09-19 10:27:23","","5565-5570","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the breakthrough in rechargeable batteries and wireless energy transfer technology provides a promising solution for replenishing sensors wirelessly. The existing researches only paid their attention to reducing the UAV travelling distance, while the UAV charging efficiency is overlooked. To fill this gap, we devote this paper to developing an Efficient UAV Charging Trajectory scheme (EUCT) for large-scale WSNs. Technically, we first formulate a dual-objective optimization problem to minimize the number of the dead nodes and maximize the UAV charging efficiency. In order to solve this problem, a series of algorithms are proposed. Specifically, a coarse trajectory construction algorithm is first presented to form a basic feasible charging path. In order to improve the UAV charging efficiency, a trajectory refinement algorithm is then developed. Subsequently, a global trajectory optimization scheme is further proposed to minimize the number of the dead nodes. The simulation results demonstrate that our EUCT scheme performs best in terms of the node survival rate and the UAV charging efficiency.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:23","2023-09-19 10:27:23","","5571-5576","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maintaining data privacy and cost efficiency remain core challenges for the viability of EED-enabled computing paradigms. In this context, we propose the Community-Oriented Resource Allocation (CORA) scheme. CORA exploits business, institutional, and social relationships to build clusters and communities of requesters and EEDs that can eliminate recruitment costs and preserve privacy. However, community-imposed constraints on resource allocation can lead to unbalanced work distribution. To address this issue, CORA considers community restrictions, minimizes flowtime and makespan for the allocated services, and retains a reasonable scheduler runtime for real-time resource allocation. Towards that end, CORA formulates the resource allocation problem as a Bipartite Graph Matching problem. Furthermore, CORA exposes tuneable parameters that allow prioritizing flowtime or makespan, making it suitable for different scenarios. Extensive simulations show that CORA outperforms six prominent heuristic-based resource allocation schemes by up to 24% in terms of average makespan while sustaining the same level of flowtime and runtime.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:24","2023-09-19 10:27:24","","5583-5588","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have recently been proposed to find the optimal tradeoff between sensing and communication performance. However, these studies assume continuous transmission and thus consider that the time available for estimation can always be large enough to achieve some desired accuracy. Moreover, in line with this assumption, communication performance is measured via the well-known Shannon capacity, which implicitly assumes indefinitely long error correction codes. However, in the case of short packet transmissions, such as the case in several IoT applications, the above assumption is unrealistic, as the length of the transmitted packet limits that of the error correction code and the observation time for parameter estimation. Therefore, this paper aims at investigating the optimal tradeoff between the data transmission and the target localization capabilities in a finite block-length regime, by making use of some typical metrics of the finite length information theory. In particular, the optimal beamforming, which minimizes the Cramér Rao bound of target localization, is derived under a constraint over the block error probability for given packet length values.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:24","2023-09-19 10:27:24","","5595-5600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Usually, this technique requires all the anchors and targets, e.g., the satellites and the mobile phones in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), to actively transmit/receive radio signals such that the delay of the one-way radio signal propagated between each anchor and each target can be measured. Excitingly, this paper will show that the trilateration technique can be generalized to the scenario where one of the three anchors and all the targets merely reflect the radio signals passively as in radar networks, even if the propagation delay between the passive IRS and the passive targets is difficult to be measured directly, and the data association issue for multi-sensor multi-target tracking arises. Specifically, we consider device-free sensing in a cellular network consisting of two base stations (BSs), one passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), and multiple passive targets, to realize integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). The two BSs transmit the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals in the downlink and estimate the locations of the targets based on their reflected signals via/not via the IRS. We propose an efficient trilateration-based strategy that can first estimate the distances of each target to the two BSs and the IRS and then localize the targets.

Edge devices are mainly resource-constrained and hence can not afford the computational complexity manifested by DNNs. Thereby, researchers have resorted to a collaborative computing approach, where a DNN is partitioned between edge and cloud. Recent art on DNN partitioning has either focused on bandwidth-specific partitioning or relied on offline benchmarking of DNN layers. However, edge devices are inherently heterogeneous and possess inconsistent levels and types of resources. Therefore, in this work, we propose a resource-aware partitioning of DNNs for accelerating collaborative inference over edge-cloud. The proposed approach provides the flexibility of partitioning a DNN with respect to the available nature and scale of resources for a certain edge device. Unlike state-of-the-art, we exploit different types of DNN complexities for partitioning them on heterogeneous edge devices. For example, in a bandwidth-constrained scenario, our approach gained 40% efficiency as compared to the offline benchmarking approach. Therefore, given the different nature of edge devices' computational, storage, and energy requirements, this approach provides a suitable configuration for edge-cloud synergetic inference.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:26","2023-09-19 10:27:26","","5649-5655","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can be attributed to the ability of EC to bring the computational resources within close proximity to end-users, which significantly improves the response time. However, performance gain in EC can be compromised by service interruptions triggered by various dynamic changes. Consequently, reliable service migration is crucial in EC. However, most service migration schemes either fail to consider the profound impact of the dynamic computation load on service continuity or provide impractical and time-inefficient solutions based on optimization techniques. This paper proposes the Heuristic-based Load-induced Proactive Migration (HLPM) scheme. HLPM incorporates a Finite State Machine (FSM) to model the dynamic computation load.

Performance evaluation shows that HLPM produces a significant decrease of up to 97% in migration decision latency compared to conventional optimization techniques.

Fair resource allocation is a primary concern in such computing paradigms. However, fairness is typically considered from the requester's perspective, whereas fairness for workers (i.e., EEDs) is mostly overlooked. In this context, we propose the Multitiered Worker-Oriented Resource Allocation (MWORA) scheme. In MWORA, the resource allocation problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). MWORA aims to maximize service capacity and minimize the task response delay while enabling fair resource allocation that maintains a specific satisfactory profit for workers. Such a satisfactory level is maintained to prevent the workers from leaving the system and ensure their recurrent subscription to the service. This is done while abiding by the deadline demanded by each requester and without exceeding a certain budget. MWORA also accounts for the fact that EEDs are user-owned devices and are thus subject to a dynamic user access behavior, which can affect the level of computational resources that workers are willing to offer. In particular, MWORA enables multitiered computational resources to be granted by each worker depending on the price of the allocated task. Extensive simulations have shown that MWORA outperforms other baseline resource allocation schemes regarding average response delay, service capacity, worker satisfaction ratio, and fairness.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:27","2023-09-19 10:27:27","","5674-5679","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, we aim to study the paradigm data acquisition, where the UAV dynamically gathers information by on-board sensors. In this paper, we consider the scenario where a UAV acquires data in real time, which needs to be timely processed with the assistance of a mobile edge computing server. To address the real-time data acquisition characteristics, we construct a novel data acquisition rate model, which is with respect to the UAV speed. Next, we formulate a UAV energy consumption minimization problem that jointly considers UAV trajectory, transmission power, and CPU frequency. To tackle the highly complex problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, and rigorously derive a closed-form solution for the UAV transmission power and computation resources allocation. With the obtained numerical results, we further validate the superiority of the proposed system design and the effectiveness of our algorithm against benchmark schemes.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:27","2023-09-19 10:27:27","","5680-5685","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it requires the scheduler and transceivers to make joint decisions under coupled constraints. In this work, we identify that the joint job scheduling and bandwidth augmentation problem is a complex mixed integer nonlinear problem, which is not solvable by existing optimization methods. To address this bottleneck, we transform it into an equivalent problem based on the coupling of its heuristic bounds, the revised data transfer representation and non-linear constraints decoupling and reformulation, such that the optimal solution can be efficiently acquired by the Branch and Bound method. Based on the proposed method, the performance of job scheduling with and without bandwidth augmentation is studied.

However, IoVT also imposes massive computation and transmission on mobile edge computing (MEC) systems with a large amount of offloaded video data. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted multi-MEC IoVT system. Although NOMA-assisted MEC systems have been proposed in existing studies, non-negligible inter-device interference caused by NOMA transmission has not been investigated, which is much more serious in multi-MEC IoVT systems. To combat them, we perform joint optimization on grouping and offloading in the proposed NOMA-assisted multi-MEC IoVT system. To achieve optimal performance, a utility minimization problem is formulated where the definition of utility leverages critical performance metrics including energy consumption and delay. We prove that this problem can be modeled as an exact potential game. Then, a selection algorithm is proposed to find the optimal strategies for each IoVT device by obtaining the Nash equilibrium. Specifically, power allocation for IoVT devices can be handled by a computation resource minimization problem.

Congestion-awareness is essential to limit the channel load increase, leading to packet loss and rising access delays. Previously, channel busy ratio (CBR) thresholds have been derived under static load conditions, the investigation of time-varying load conditions remained open. This work provides the first investigation on threshold-based repetition allocation under time-varying load conditions, focusing on the accuracy and timeliness of the CBR observation. Therefore, we evaluate the impact on the achievable transmission range and end-to-end delay. The results show a trade-off between responsiveness to load changes achieved by short, and high accuracy achieved for long observation windows. While short observations allow to quickly adapt to load changes, which avoid performance degradation due to temporarily channel congestion, the observation underlies severe fluctuations leading misallocations causing performance loss. In contrast, long observations allow to avoid wrong allocations, instead they tend to oscillations. Based on the results, the dynamic adaptation of the observation time based on the load history is proposed. It shows that the adaptation using a simple threshold-based detection of load changes does not only quickly converges to the optimal allocation, but also reduces false and oscillating allocations.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:28","2023-09-19 10:27:28","","5723-5728","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We design vNetRadar, a virtual network measurement system, which has these excellent characteristics simultaneously. Specifically, vNetRadar 1) identifies each packet without increasing the size of each packet, to obtain network-wide metrics without MTU modification, 2) allocates each packet an area in memory, called backpack, and carries metadata in it to largely reduce bandwidth overhead. vNetRadar is implemented based on the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and is mainly in kernel space, avoiding the CPU overhead of copying packets to user space when performing the fine-grained measurement.

With the number of rules for classification and packets arriving at routers per second reaching 100's of thousands to millions, special hardware is also being built for packet classification to increase throughput at routers. Sorting packets (based on various conditions) in the buffers offers a significant advantage for the packet classification process. The sorting step is a time-consuming step given the large volume of packets in the incoming buffers. We propose a technique to approximately sort the packets by capping the maximum number of comparisons that can be made. We show that the performance of well-known decision tree-based packet classification methods such as HyperCuts, EffiCuts, and SmartSplits can be improved by more than 32% with approximate sorting for when the number of packets is less than 10K at any given time.

A Q-learning-assisted algorithm is designed to allocate the transmit power and frequency sub-bands at the O-RAN control layer such that interference from macro gNB to SBS devices is minimized while ensuring the QoS of the maximum number of devices. The numerical results show that the proposed method enhances the overall spectral efficiency of the NOMA-based TS use case without adding to the system's complexity or cost compared to traditional HetNet topologies such as co-channel deployments and dedicated channel deployments.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:30","2023-09-19 10:27:30","","5771-5776","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Timely detection of malicious nodes in future networks is significant for low-latency backhaul/fronthaul networks. However, conventional supervised learning-based detection models require abundant malicious training samples, while capturing adequate malicious samples can not meet the requirement of timely detection. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot malicious node detection system for improving QoS of IoT backhaul/fronthaul network, which can detect malicious nodes with unknown malicious activities through a limited number of network traffic samples. In our proposed system, we first design a fresh IoT traffic sample processing approach, which integrates normal activity samples and known malicious activity samples to generate training pairs. Then, we design a metric learning-based malicious node detection model training method, which employs a contrastive loss over distance metric to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs of samples. Besides, the trained model can detect nodes with unknown malicious activities by comparing real-time samples with few-shot samples of malicious nodes. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated on a real-world IoT network dataset named N-BaIoT. The exhaustive experiment results show that our model can achieve an average accuracy around 97.67 % when detecting malicious nodes with unknown malicious activities, which is comparable to state-of-the-art supervised learning models while our model only needs 5-shot samples of malicious node.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:31","2023-09-19 10:27:31","","5777-5782","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas, the satisfaction level of vehicles has been playing an important role in stimulating vehicles to pursue better quality of experience by task offloading and service outsourcing operations. In the meanwhile, there is an inescapable fact, i.e., the task execution in VEC may fail due to various reasons, and thus it is important to incorporate the failure-resisted task offloading into the failure-prone VEC system. In this paper, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of all the vehicles, while considering the potential failures in VEC. Specifically, we model satisfaction optimization as a multiple knapsack problem and further put forward a greedy heuristic approach to solve this problem in polynomial time. Extensive simulation is carried out to validate the efficiency of our approach in terms of the optimal values and the running time.

Despite the easy management of these infrastructures, they are limited in dealing with variations in the demand of mobile users. To cope with that, fog nodes can be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be quickly deployed, staying close to those users requiring low latency services. The location and period of operation of UAVs must be determined to maximize the number of requests processed and reduce the latency in accessing the infrastructure. This paper proposes a solution to the fog node location problem with rotary-wing UAVs that considers variable demands. We have modeled the problem with an integer linear programming formulation and have proposed the Sequential UAV Fog Node Location algorithm to deal with large scenarios. The results derived using real traces show that low delay applications can be supported.

To this goal, the DT first chops the data into blocks and cache them in the RSUs along the driving path of the vehicle. The vehicle can then retrieve the blocks when driving into the RSU's coverage to recover the data. Since RSUs have different cache capacities and communication costs, the DT needs to determine how to optimally distribute the data blocks at RSUs so that vehicles can finish downloading all the data before the deadline yet with the minimal cost. To determine the optimal delivery strategy of DT, we model the problem as an optimization framework subject to the time-varying wireless channel of RSUs, their service load and the communication cost.

Departing from the proposition that computing capabilities can help overcome resource allocation problems in vehicular clouds (VCs), in this paper, we formulate ALTAIC, a coalition game to maximize resource utilization while dynamically load-balancing the usage among the VCs. First, we define a Shapley value-based strategy to determine the order in which the tasks are allocated. Then, with the marginal contribution of each task calculated, we employ a simple queue to allocate the tasks in VCs using these values.

Vehicular fog computing migrates computation services close to the edge of the network, which can break the long response latency limitation of cloud computing. However, the high mobility and random distribution of vehicles lead to the difficulty of the fog infrastructure deployment and the offloading decision. In this paper, we investigate the latency minimization problem in the regionalized three-tier vehicular fog network, which is divided into the sub-problems of single-region offloading decision and multi-region resource allocation. In particular, we make the preliminary offloading decision for users in each roadside unit (RSU) coverage area to solve the single-region offloading decision problem. We also transfer the multi-region resource allocation problem into a group-knapsack problem to obtain the optimal resource allocation results among all the users in the base station coverage area.

Specifically, new Fault location, Isolation, and service Recovery (FLISR) functions have been proposed to improve the reactivity and the coordination of the grid defense lines. However, both connectivity and energy consumption remain the major challenges. Indeed, protection assets need to communicate with FLISR functions with critical communication requirements ranging from best-effort to ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (uRLLC) services. Besides these connectivity challenges, the energy consumption of modern telecommunication networks is highly critical. In this context, we present in this paper an energy-efficient framework for joint routing and link scheduling of FLISR traffic in 5G mobile networks. To achieve this, we formulate the problem as an integer linear program (ILP) and present an optimal solution to solve it. Our objective is to find the best trade-off between the achieved network throughput and energy consumption, while ensuring the latency constraint of FLISR traffic. Our approach is compliant with the Software-Defined Radio Access Network (SD-RAN) paradigm since it can be integrated as a control flow application on top of an SD-RAN controller. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed approach achieves significant gains in terms of energy consumption, flow acceptance and achieved network throughput, compared to baseline routing strategies.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:35","2023-09-19 10:27:35","","5874-5879","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Apart from tackling the video processing issues in applications, such as object identification and tracking, energy consumption that may present a stumbling block in completing a successful drone flight for data collecting must be highlighted and considered. Drones have a limited amount of energy storage, which must be used to power the drone's movement, hovering, data collection, and communication. This study aims at building and testing a drone energy profile that estimates the total energy consumed and a maximum flying time of a drone in a traffic monitoring scenario. Additionally, the relationship between the video processing task and the drone energy profile is explored to determine the optimal strategy for flying the drones while maintaining the video processing task's performance.

The task's criticality is dependent on the drones' dynamic altitude, movable camera, and various viewing angles. These challenges are addressed once the UAVs' collected data is received. However, parameters affecting drone data collecting flight operations must also be explored, including drone actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile. The drone flight time would depend upon the battery capacity and energy consumption profile, which comprises drone movement, data collection, and communication energies. Besides, data collection energy consumption is subjected to video quality, frame rates, and data compression. The installed battery in UAVs is of limited capacity and determining actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile based on the factors mentioned above is critical. This paper develops and examines a drone energy consumption profile and proposes a drone flight strategy in a surveillance scenario to correctly estimate the drone's actual flight time, data collection time, and the distance the drone could travel from its original location.

In multi-tier VEC system, the offloading of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) can be supported using the Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C- V2X) links, through Uu or PC5 interfaces.

We aim to minimize the total system latency of the task processing to optimize the offloading ratio matrix and packet transmit frequency of the PC5 interface, and computation resource allocation of vehicles and VEC server.

The significance of this new metric is that it can measure the correlation of the meaning between semantic information and the original image.

In crisis cases such as flooding or earthquakes, one or more UAVs might be non-functional, resulting in a disconnected network. Due to the continuous changes in S-UAVs, one of the most reliable routing schemes is clustering. Clustering scheme splits the network into clusters with a cluster head and cluster members. The cluster head is responsible for all intra-cluster communication, which consists of communication between the clusters. The selection of the cluster head has a high impact on the performance of the routing scheme. This paper proposes a new clustered weighted scheme with redundancy to ensure end-to-end communication even with some non-functional UAVs. The proposed protocol has a new weighted formula for the primary cluster head selection. In addition, the proposed protocol selects the secondary cluster heads based on an elimination process. The parameters of the weighted formula are the distance, the speed, and the rewarding index. The rewarding index is calculated based on the latency. This protocol proposes the presence of a secondary cluster head that automatically replaces the primary cluster head whenever it is non-functional, thus ensuring the stability of the connection. The proposed scheme is simulated using MATLAB. The results obtained are discussed towards the end of this paper. The obtained results conclude that this is a promising protocol to decrease data loss in a crisis case scenario.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:43","2023-09-19 10:27:43","","5971-5976","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aim to jointly optimize the UAV's trajectory and the information collection order of the ground targets to minimize the mission completion time. The formulated problem is NP-hard due to the need of visiting the information collection locations for all targets; moreover, the UAV's trajectories over different time durations are coupled in non-convex constraints for ensuring information transmission completion.

We model the fluctuations of the UAV platform pitch angle (caused by wobbling) by a sinusoidal stochastic process. On the other hand, the combined effect of all hardware impairments is modeled by two wide-sense stationary (WSS) additive and multiplicative distortion noise processes, which is a well-accepted approach in the literature. Using this unified model, we characterize the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the impairments-aware channel impulse response, which further provides the coherence time of the channel. We also derive the power spectral density (PSD) of the distortion-plus-noise process of our unified channel model. To obtain useful insights from the joint impact of physical and hardware impairments on the air-to-ground wireless channel, we evaluate both of these metrics with reasonable impairment models and parameters. One key implication of our results is that the channel coherence time degrades noticeably at high frequencies even for small wobbling, which renders channel estimation of UAV links extremely challenging at these frequencies.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:44","2023-09-19 10:27:44","","5983-5988","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The unstable air-to-air link characteristics and ultra-dynamic topology become the main differences between AANETs and usual ad-hoc architectures. To handle these differences, the AANET topology could be created in the form of clusters by collecting airplanes having similar features under the same set. However, it is also difficult to sustain the cluster topologies since ultra-dynamic characteristics still affect them. Therefore, the current cluster topology must be continuously mapped to the airplanes to notify them as a part of sustainability. If we do not ensure the sustainability of the clusters, the packet transfer success of AANET is decreased with higher end-to-end latency. At that point, to solve this aircraft notification problem and map the current cluster topology to them at each timestamp, in this paper, we propose a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based topology mapping mechanism for AANETs. Here, the GRU can continuously notify the airplanes at each timestamp about topology changes. Therefore, airplanes can forget the old topology when it changes. Otherwise, the topology taken from the previous timestamp is continuously remembered if it does not change. Finally, the performance evaluations reveal that the GRU-aided topology mapping can achieve roughly 42% higher packet delivery ratio with 34% reduced end-to-end latency.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:27:45","2023-09-19 10:27:45","","5989-5994","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the problem is a non-convex and non-linear mixed-integer programming, low-complexity efficient greedy-based algorithmic solutions are proposed. The first one finds the UAVs' best positions and allocates resource whereas the second one guarantees the problem feasibility (i.e., all users can be satisfied) by removing the worst users.

Can content recommenders compensate for low QoS? To answer this question, we conducted experiments over the Internet, and report our findings on (i) the characterization of QoS and (ii) the compensation for low QoS. Our measurements suggest that content that is far from the trends tends to be far from the user. We quantify the extent at which unpopular content tends to be served with lower QoS and establish a methodology to determine the relationship between contents' popularity and its physical proximity to the users.

In this paper, we investigate the interplay between distributed AI workflow and ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) services running concurrently over a network. Using 3GPP compliant simulations in a factory automation use case, we show the impact of various distributed AI settings (e.g., model size and the number of participating devices) on the convergence time of distributed AI and the application layer performance of URLLC. Unless we leverage the existing 5G-NR quality of service handling mechanisms to separate the traffic from the two services, our simulation results show that the impact of distributed AI on the availability of the URLLC devices is significant. Moreover, with proper setting of distributed AI (e.g., proper user selection), we can substantially reduce network resource utilization, leading to lower latency for distributed AI and higher availability for the URLLC users.

In this case, it is infeasible to derive the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. Additionally, the analytical channel estimators, e.g., the least square (LS) estimator and the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator are computational costly and imprecise for practical RIS-aided systems.

The major challenge for passive users, such as Radio Astronomy Services (RAS), is the need for extremely quiet skies to make astronomical observations with maximum sensitivity of the radio telescope. This is increasingly difficult to guarantee because of densification of allocated spectrum, exponential growth of ubiquitous wireless communication and out-of-band astronomical observations required to observe fast radio bursts. This requires either bidirectional collaboration between active and passive users or innovative signal processing at the telescope site to cancel any incident Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). In this work, we show the feasibility of such a paradigm, where RFI from airborne sources, e.g., aircraft, LEO satellites, etc., is cancelled at the receiver of a Radio Telescope, by shaping the EM wavefront by an array of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). In contrast to conventional beam-nulling applications for RIS, this method requires precise calculation of the phase and the amplitude of the reflected signal by the RIS in order to guarantee complete cancellation of the incident RFI. We simulate this approach in a practical setting to study its error performance and boundary conditions of the system parameters, that will lead to a demonstrable prototype in near future.

At the receiver side, the maximum a posteriori detection applies to the received sequences that contain information of the codeword at the current time instance, where priorly decoded codewords aid the detection. The channel code decoding is then performed, and extrinsic messages are exploited for the codeword estimations of the following time instances.

However, recent low-power wireless chipsets offer both the IEEE 802.15.4 and all four PHYs of the Bluetooth 5 (BT 5) standard. This introduces the intriguing possibility that IoT solutions might not necessarily be bound by the limits of a single PHY, and could actively or proactively adapt their PHY depending on RF or networking conditions (e.g., to offer a higher throughput or a longer radio range). Several recent studies have explored such use-cases. However, these studies lack comprehensive evaluation over various metrics (such as reliability, latency, and energy) with regards to scalability and the Radio Frequency (RF) environment. In this work we evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 and the four BT 5 2.4GHz PHY options for the recently completed IETF 6TiSCH low-power wireless standard. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly compare these PHYs in identical settings. Specifically, we use a recently released 6TiSCH simulator, TSCH-Sim, to compare these PHY options in networks of up to 250 nodes over different RF environments (home, industrial, and outdoor), and highlight from these results how different PHY options might be better suited to particular application use-cases.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:46","2023-09-19 10:29:46","","4280-4285","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we propose an architecture that uses collected network information to realize jitter buffering suitable for user-managed IoT device control applications in the All-Photonics Network. The architecture collects end-to-end delay values in real-time, implements jitter buffer based on the obtained values, and performs more detailed delay compensation control based on fixed delay values. This allows network conditions, which are normally out of user's control, to optimize the user's IoT device control application.

It also aims to evaluate operational strategies and their effect on the battery life when the ECG patch can switch between different operating modes (e.g., varying the number of leads according to the cardiac conditions). We use a binary classifier to inform the decision of switching between different operational strategies. Both scenarios are evaluated in terms of execution time, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication airtime, power consumption, and energy-saving ratios on a Texas Instruments CC2650 Micro-controller Unit (MCU). We compare the performance of the base-delta compression and changing the mode of operation scenarios on various cardiac abnormalities. Performance evaluation shows that operational strategies outperforms data compression in power saving for normal ECG readings by a double fold. In contrast, operational strategies incurs an additional overhead of 1011 ms during an abnormal status.

Due to the sensitivity of the exchanged data between different entities, C- ITS systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks, they require high protection. In order to guarantee the integrity and the authentication of the exchanged messages, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), has specified specific procedures to manage certificates and signatures of all sent messages. Each vehicle periodically sends signed CAMs. Then, the integration of the signature and certificate in each transmitted CAM has a considerable impact on the communication channel load and bandwidth. In this study, we propose a new lightweight authentication mechanism which uses the cluster concept to decrease the network overhead. The objective is to reduce the number of signatures and certificates on all exchanged messages. The key idea is that neighbouring vehicles form a cluster to establish a trust relationship with each other, thus removing the need to send signed messages each time. Our method allows for the exchange of lightweight data without certificates or signatures (unsigned CAMs) and therefore verification and signature processes are no longer necessary all the time, which saves processing time and allows for smoother and faster communications.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:47","2023-09-19 10:29:47","","4304-4309","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, many researchers design intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to detect vehicle intrusion in real-time. In this paper, we propose a highly camouflaged attack method called the same origin method execution (SOME) attack. The intrusion messages of this attack have the same characteristics as normal messages and can bypass most existing IDSs. To detect this attack, we design a reliable IDS for ICV based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) called GVIDS. It takes CAN messages as the input sample and trains the IDS model to distinguish the legality of messages. Experiments on two real vehicles show that GVIDS can detect most existing attacks, including spoofing, bus-off, masquerade, and SOME attacks. The average detection accuracy of GVIDS is 96.64%, and the average running time of each detection is only 0.18 ms.

As the IoT connects a massive number of devices, inevitable security threats must be addressed. On the one hand, machine learning (ML), especially federated learning (FL), is proposed as a promising distributed ML paradigm to improve attack detection performance in the IoT network due to its privacy-preserving and lower latency advantages. On the other hand, blockchain is proposed as a decentralized technology to establish a secure and decentralized environment for IoT devices. However, $F$L and blockchain solutions are not well suited for the IoT context that suffers from resource limitations, such as limited communication bandwidth and scarce computing resources of IoT devices. In addition, traditional FL and blockchain solutions are unable to guarantee the reliability of data. In this paper, we present a decentralized FL framework powered by blockchain for security attack protection in IoT systems. In addition, we propose an oracle blockchain network that protects privacy and guarantees data reliability. The oracle blockchain acts as a trusted third party to verify the reliability of data and pattern formation at the network edge. Finally, we will formulate a resource allocation problem to allocate the necessary bandwidth to selected devices meticulously.

This paper opts to tackle such vulnerability and presents a novel and effective solution for mutual authentication of IoT nodes. The proposed solution calls for embedding a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) on each device, and employs a lightweight protocol for validating the identity of the individual devices based on querying the PUF. To authenticate a “prover” node, a verifier node will send a challenge bit-stream to the prover, where the latter provides the response of its PUF to such a challenge to be matched by what the verifier expects. To prevent the PUF of a prover from being modeled by an eavesdropper or a collusive set of compromised verifiers, the proposed protocol makes the response to a challenge dependent on the verifier. In addition, our protocol combines such an identity-based response generation with a simple Elliptic curve to thwart any attempts by a compromised verifier to reverse engineer the response generation process. The robustness of our PUF-based IoT Device Authentication (PIDA) protocol, is validated using data collected from an FPGA-based implementation.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:48","2023-09-19 10:29:48","","4328-4333","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we design a privacy preserving targeted advertising strategy for the wireless edge Metaverse. Specifically, a Metaverse service provider (MSP) allocates bandwidth to the VR users so that the users can access Metaverse from edge access points. To protect users' privacy, the covert communication technique is used in the downlink. Then, the MSP can offer high-quality access services to earn more profits. Motivated by the concept of “covert”, targeted advertising is used to promote the sale of bandwidth and ensure that the advertising strategy cannot be detected by competitors who may make counter-offer and by attackers who want to disrupt the services. We derive the best advertising strategy in terms of budget input, with the help of the Vidale-Wolfe model and Hamiltonian function. Furthermore, we propose a novel metric named Meta-Immersion to represent the user's experience feelings.

However, in practical applications, users (referred to as workers) may report outliers due to device malfunction, malicious workers, etc. These outliers will dramatically impact the accuracy of the truth discovery result. Detecting outliers based on existing privacy preservation schemes will carry an intolerable overhead, dramatically reducing the system's availability. In this paper, we propose our privacy-preserving truth discovery scheme that can detect outliers. Specifically, we adopt an anonymous mechanism to achieve privacy preservation. Since the existing anonymous mechanisms require huge overhead and do not work correctly when some workers exit, they are difficult to be applied in mobile crowdsensing systems. We design a lightweight and robust anonymous mechanism based on the edge computing paradigm. In addition, we eliminate the impact of outliers through outlier detection to achieve robustness of truth discovery results.

However, FL is still facing model confidentiality issues. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a quantum key distribution (QKD) based secure FL scheme to facilitate FL model encryption against network eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, we introduce a stochastic resource allocation scheme for QKD to support FL networks. In the network, remote FL workers are connected to the server to train an aggregated global model in a distributed manner. However, due to the unpredictable number of workers at each location, the demand for secret-key rates to support secure model transmission to the server is not uniform. The proposed scheme can allocate QKD resources (i.e., wavelengths) in a way that minimizes the total cost given the stochastic demand. We formulate the optimization problem for the proposed scheme as a stochastic programming model. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can successfully achieve the cost-minimizing objective while satisfying all uncertain demands and other security constraints.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:49","2023-09-19 10:29:49","","4377-4382","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the number of devices increases, this centralized model not only faces severe network load issues and single point of failure crises, but also raises various security and privacy concerns. Fortunately, blockchain can provide decentral-ization, high trustworthiness and security. Therefore, to design a distributed IIoT system, a blockchain-based IIoT would be a reasonable choice. This paper combines the consortium chain and the homomorphic Paillier algorithm, and proposes a secure distributed data aggregation and verfication (SDAV) mechanism based on the consortium chain. This mechanism combines edge computing and blockchain technology to build a distributed data aggregation framework, which effectively supports the secure collection and storage of data, and avoids single point of failure and tampering crisis. Secondly, based on the (k, t)-threshold Paillier algorithm, a secure cryptographic verification mechanism is designed to protect the privacy and confidentiality of data on the blockchain.

But the network overhead of remote access and the dynamically changing workload restrict the performance of the state sharing framework. The state-of-the-art state sharing frameworks mainly use the affinity strategy to migrate the target state from another node to itself. This strategy is unsuitable for asymmetric routing scenario because multiple nodes will access the same state. This paper presents RedKV, a fast and flexible Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) Enhanced Distributed Key-Value store that supports low-latency state sharing both in symmetric and asymmetric routing scenarios. RedKV has two unconventional designs: First, it scatters states over cluster nodes without affinity strategy and uses a unified addressing (UA) space to hide the complexity of state access. Second, it accelerates the operation with RDMA and optimizes the process according to the characteristics of RDMA and NF to mitigate the cost of remote access. Our evaluation shows that RedKV can help network functions share states with an added latency overhead of 2.26µs, outperforming state-of-art solutions by 4.6 times.

In this regard, a multi-agent-based network automation architecture as a service design is proposed. The architecture introduces in-network intelligence, designing intelligent agents as the fundamental unit which is used as a building block in autonomous network system design. This work focuses on the dynamic agent placement problems in edge/cloud data centers. Agents are softwarized and intelligent versions of network functions that are traditionally implemented in hardware such as firewalls, packet gateways, etc. This paper, based on a combination of proactive and reactive solutions, considered decision accuracy in developing an intelligent decision algorithm that can be used in the prediction agent design. The proactive decision is based on a deep learning prediction algorithm using time-series workload forecasting. However, in case of unforeseen events that are missing from the historical dataset, the proactive decisions could be less reliable. Therefore, network-state feedback should be considered to determine the current network conditions using the change in instant arrival rate as a reactive decision. Then combining it with the proactive decision should be able to capture the unpredictable traffic spikes. The result is used to determine the number and type of agents to instantiate at a given time in the edge/cloud data centers.

Moreover, the heterogeneous applications of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications need an efficient management of the nodes' resources to satisfy the diverse requirements of the vehicles' demands. To this end, network slicing could be a promising solution. Task offloading algorithms in VEC proposed in the literature usually rely on offloading to a 5G base station (gNodeB) or a Road Side Unit (RSU) and do not differentiate between the various vehicular demands. In this paper, we study the task offloading problem with network slicing in V2X communications from vehicles to edge computing nodes hosted at gNodeBs, RSUs, and nearby vehicles. We model the network and formulate the problem as an integer linear program, with the objective of maximizing the volume of offloaded tasks from diverse services. We propose a heuristic algorithm and slicing schemes to find a near-optimal solution to the NP hard optimization problem. The simulation results show that considering offloading at nearby vehicles in addition to RSUs and gNodeBs yields better results in terms of acceptance ratio and resource utilization.

To be easier in deployment, we introduce a small state table and design a protocol between load balancers and the controller to maintain per-connection consistency in a dynamic environment without modifying running applications. The state table stores small amounts of connection states temporarily to ensure consistent load balancing decisions under device variations. We implemented CDLB with bmv2 in the mininet environment.

By deploying Edge servers at the network's edge, close to the vehicles, such applications can be successfully delivered while adhering to low-latency and high-throughput requirements. However, optimal placement of Edge servers is challenging since it necessitates a trade-off between quality of service and deployment cost. Latency can be reduced by placing as many Edge servers as feasible close to the vehicles, however, this results in significant deployment costs. This work addresses the problem of optimal Edge server placement. It solves this problem using integer linear programming, considering the relation between delay and cost, as well as the capacity of Edge servers in realistic road traffic scenarios. The proposed generic methodology is designed to reduce the cost of deploying Edge servers by combining the achievement of the desired latency threshold with workload balancing between Edge servers.

It is necessary to establish an accurate air-to-ground (A2G) wireless channel model. In this paper, a A2G channel model with UAV three-dimensional (3D) wobbles (pitch, roll, and yaw) is proposed. The internal vibration of the UAV is modeled as a sinusoidal random process, and the UAV wobble caused by the random air fluctuations is modeled as the uniform distribution random process. We derive the A2G channel temporal auto-correlation function (ACF) with UAV 3D wobbles, analyze the variation of the temporal ACF with different time instants, carrier frequencies, and amplitudes of the wobble angles. It is found that, even if the UAV wobbles slightly, the channel temporal correlation will be significantly affected. Numerical results show that the channel ACF will decrease rapidly with the increase of the amplitudes of the wobble angles and the carrier frequency. This work contributes to the establishment of the next generation wireless channel model and the design of communication system.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:53","2023-09-19 10:29:53","","4473-4478","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UAV-to-ground (U-G) type of communications in densely populated areas due to dynamic and highly varying propagation conditions are usually characterized by composite fading channels. This paper considers the extension of the recently proposed and experimentally verified double-scattered double-shadowed (ds-ds) composite fading model for U-G communications. We model the ds-ds fading channel as a product of double generalized gamma (d-GG) and double inverse gamma (d-IG) random variables (RV s) and provide novel SNR expressions for the probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) expressed in terms of MeijerG and BesselK functions. Based on the derived pdf and cdf statistics, we assess performance metrics (P-M) of U-G communications in terms of outage probability, average bit error rate and ergodic channel capacity. Numerical results for the observed P-M are presented and analyzed for various sets of ds-ds fading propagation parameters.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:54","2023-09-19 10:29:54","","4479-4484","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivated by this, in this paper, we present a comprehensive system model that accounts the impact of multi-path fading, which is modeled by means of mixture gamma, transceiver hardware imperfections, and stochastic beam disorientation and misalignment in order to examine the throughput performance of a RIS-assisted UAV wireless system. In this direction, we present a novel closed-form expression for the systems throughput for two scenarios: i) in the presence and ii) in the absence of disorientation and misalignment.

The framework takes full advantage of the GPU's powerful parallel computing capabilities. Specifically, we decompose each user task into sequential segments and parallel segments, which can be offloaded to CPUs and GPUs of the ECs, respectively. By dis-cretizing the GPU's computing capability, we formulate a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP), which involves jointly optimizing the task offloading decision, the uplink transmission power of users, and computing resource allocation. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a Joint Simulated Annealing and Convex Optimization (JSAC) based algorithm to minimize the total overhead consisting of delay and energy consumption. Our experimental simulation results demonstrate that the JSAC algorithm can make full use of GPU's powerful parallel computing capability via allocating GPU resources effectively.

To provide these services, Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) must be established and reachable by end-users, which will generate and consume massive volumes of data that must be processed locally for service responsiveness and scalability. For this to be realized, a solid cloud-network Integrated infrastructure is a necessity, and since cloud and network domains would be diverse in terms of characteristics but limited in terms of capability, communication and computing resources should be jointly controlled to unleash its full potential. Although several innovative methods have been proposed to allocate the resources, most of them either ignored network resources or relaxed the network as a simple graph, which are not applicable to Beyond 5G because of its dynamism and stringent QoS requirements. This paper fills in the gap by studying the joint problem of communication and computing resource allocation, dubbed CCRA, including VNF placement and assignment, traffic prioritization, and path selection considering capacity constraints as well as link and queuing delays, with the goal of minimizing overall cost. We formulate the problem as a non-linear programming model, and propose two approaches, dubbed B&B-CCRA and WF-CCRA respectively, based on the Branch & Bound and Water-Filling algorithms.

It is critical to execute those jobs efficiently. The average job completion time (JCT) is a widely used metric to measure executing efficiency. JCT refers to the length of the time interval between a job's arrival to its completion. Typically, a data processing job contains multiple stages with complex precedence constraints. Carefully scheduling the processing sequence of stages within a job may significantly reduce its JCT. Our objective is to minimize the average JCT for online arrival jobs. The computation graphs of those jobs are usually directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It makes the scheduling problem challenging. Recent works have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) agents can adaptively adjust the scheduling policies by dynamically assigning priorities for job stages. However, we notice that other factors besides stage priories may impact the JCT significantly. In particular, we observe that inserting idle slots before large jobs may reduce the waiting time of small jobs that arrive slightly later and reduce the average JCT. We analyze the benefits of inserting idle time for simple cases theoretically and show the condition in which idle slots should be inserted for two adjacent jobs. In addition, we adapt the RL-based scheduler by integrating the observation. Experiment results on both real-world and synthetic datasets show the efficiency of our scheduler. Also, a perturbation-based method is applied to demonstrate the contribution of each proposed feature.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:55","2023-09-19 10:29:55","","4504-4509","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the assistance of network virtualization technologies, the SFU s can also be placed on edge computing (EC) servers, benefiting bandwidth relief and latency reduction. In this study, the SFU placement policy is modeled as a joint optimization problem for achieving high Quality of Service (QoS) that integrates end-to-end delay and bit rate as QoS metrics. The limitation and disparity in compute and network resources among EC servers are considered. To tackle the above optimization problem, an EC server control method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is proposed.

To this vision, it is first required that the edge servers must be deployed with the needed service to handle the offloaded task. Fortunately, by exploring cloud native computing technology, it is possible to deploy container-based microservice to MEC in a prompt way. In this case, it raises the task scheduling problem on whether to deploy a new service or to utilize an existing service to balance the overhead between data transmission and the microservice deployment (i.e., container image pulling) for overall task completion time minimization.

Via the simulations realized by a CFD simulator, statistical data for the number of received particles are obtained. These data are post-processed to obtain the statistical characterization of the turbulent effect in the reception and to derive the probability of infection.

One is to enable novel neuroengineering applications that require interfacing with neurons. The other reason is to draw inspiration for the design of synthetic molecular communication systems. Both of these goals require understanding of how the chemical synaptic signal is sensed and transduced at the synaptic receiver (Rx). While signal reception in synaptic molecular communication (SMC) depends heavily on the kinetics of the receptors employed by the synaptic Rxs, existing channel models for SMC either oversimplify the receptor kinetics or employ complex, high-dimensional kinetic schemes limited to specific types of receptors. Both approaches do not facilitate a comparative analysis of different types of natural synapses. In this paper, we propose a novel deterministic channel model for SMC which employs a generic three-state receptor model that captures the characteristics of the most important receptor types in SMC. The model is based on a transfer function expansion of Fick's diffusion equation and accounts for release, diffusion, and degradation of neurotransmitters as well as their reversible binding to finitely many generic postsynaptic receptors. The proposed SMC model is the first that allows studying the impact of the characteristic dynamics of the main postsynaptic receptor types on synaptic signal transmission. Numerical results indicate that the proposed model indeed exhibits a wide range of biologically plausible dynamics when specialized to specific natural receptor types.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:56","2023-09-19 10:29:56","","4529-4534","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the pervasive use of drones may pose a range of secure risks to sensitive areas such as airports and military bases. Hence, drone detection and identification are critical and necessary for governments and security agencies. This paper proposes a radio frequency identification (RFI) system for drones based on spectrogram and convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, spectrogram is used to represent fine-grained time-frequency characteristics of drone signals. Then CNN is designed to infer drone types by identifying their spectrograms. In practice, drones have different operating channels, and any one of them can be selected for signal transmission. It means that the carrier frequencies of their signals are unknown, which may result in misclassifications. To address this problem, we collect drone signals from all potential frequency bands, and demonstrate that carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation can significantly improve the system performance. Experimental evaluation is performed in real wireless environments involving 6 drones and a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) X310 platform. Moreover, the proposed spectrogram-based CNN can reach the best performance compared with the IQ-based and FFT-based CNNs. The classification accuracy is beyond 98% for drones operating on arbitrary channels.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:58","2023-09-19 10:29:58","","4564-4569","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Towards this aim, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires Environmental Sensing Capabilities (ESCs) to be installed along the coastal regions. Furthermore, FCC mandates that the secondary users transmit with low power levels, such that the aggregated interference and noise power in the vicinity of ESC sensors remains below −109 dBm/MHz. At this interference level, the ESC must detect 99 % of radar pulses with peak power of at least −89 dBm/MHz. In this paper, we design an enhanced ESC sensor, called ESC+, that leverages the deep learning framework called 'you only look once’ (YOLO) for signal detection using spectrograms. We propose a two-stage spectrogram-based coarse and fine signal analysis method for: (i) detecting, and characterizing radar pulses in environments where the aggregated noise and interference level goes beyond FCC restrictions, and (ii) detecting and characterizing other signal types (e.g., 5G and LTE) in the CBRS band, with a goal of determining unauthorized users.

Sensing, and subsequently recognizing blockage types, is an initial step towards signal blockage avoidance. In this context, we investigate the feasibility of using human motion recognition as a surrogate task for blockage type recognition through a set of hypothesis validation experiments using both qualitative and quantitative analysis (visual inspection and hyperparameter tuning of deep learning (DL) models, respectively). A surrogate task is useful for DL model testing and/or pre-training, thereby requiring a low amount of data to be collected from the eventual JCAS environment. Therefore, we collect and use a small dataset from a 26 GHz cellular multi-user communication device with hybrid beamforming. The data is converted into Doppler Frequency Spectrum (DFS) and used for hypothesis validations. Our research shows that (i) the presence of domain shift between data used for learning and inference requires use of DL models that can successfully handle it, (ii) DFS input data dilution to increase dataset volume should be avoided, (iii) a small volume of input data is not enough for reasonable inference performance, (iv) higher sensing resolution, causing lower sensitivity, should be handled by doing more activities/gestures per frame and lowering sampling rate, and (v) a higher reported sampling rate to STFT during pre-processing may increase performance, but should always be tested on a per learning task basis.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:58","2023-09-19 10:29:58","","4576-4582","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We employ an aerial relay station that can establish relay connections between vehicles and nearby heterogeneous edge infrastructures to relieve this situation. The computation offloading strategy design in the multivehicle multi-edge infrastructure scenario that is closely linked to system latency performance will be particularly complicated.

However, due to the transmission of large ML models from users to the server in each iteration of FL, communication on resource-constrained networks is currently a fundamental bottleneck in FL, restricting the ML model complex-ity and user participation. One of the notable trends to reduce the communication cost of FL systems is gradient compression, in which techniques in the form of sparsification or quantization are utilized. However, these methods are pre-fixed and do not capture the redundant, correlated information across parameters of the ML models, user devices' data, and iterations of FL. Further, these methods do not fully take advantage of the error-correcting capability of the FL process. In this paper, we propose the Federated Learning with Autoencoder Compression (FLAC) approach that utilizes the redundant information and error-correcting capability of FL to compress user devices' models for uplink transmission. FLAC trains an autoencoder to encode and decode users' models at the server in the Training State, and then, sends the autoencoder to user devices for compressing local models for future iterations during the Compression State. To guarantee the convergence of the FL, FLAC dynamically controls the autoencoder error by switching between the Training State and Compression State to adjust its autoencoder and its compression rate based on the error tolerance of the FL system. We theoretically prove that FLAC converges for FL systems with strongly convex ML models and non-i.i.d. data distribution. Our extensive experimental results'over three datasets with different network architectures show that FLAC can achieve compression rates ranging from 83x to 875x while staying near 7 percent of the accuracy of the non-compressed FL systems.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:29:59","2023-09-19 10:29:59","","4589-4594","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such big data transfer is increasingly carried out over connections with guaranteed bandwidth provisioned in high-performance networks, as exemplified by ESnet via advance bandwidth reservation agents such as OSCARS. Accurate performance prediction of big data transfer is vital for resource management to reserve appropriate bandwidth and optimize resource utilization. Data-driven methods using machine learning offer a promising solution to such prediction capabilities. However, most of these methods highly rely on the quality of training data and might suffer from low prediction accuracy when performance measurements are collected in environments with high dynamics or under latent effects. We propose a performance prediction method to help end users obtain a good estimate of achievable throughput, which could also be used by network managers to infer expected bandwidth usage and hence optimize bandwidth reservation and utilization. Based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), our approach is able to automatically detect intrinsic noise and identify latent effects to enhance prediction accuracy.

A new operation protocol of MF-RIS is presented, and then a sum rate (SR) maximization problem is formulated for an MF-RIS aided multi-user network. Next, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve this non-convex problem. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we determine the number of reflection elements required for MF-RISs to outperform self-sustainable RISs. Finally, our numerical results show that: 1) MF-RISs are able to provide up to 81.1% higher SR than the self-sustainable RISs. 2) Unlike the SF-RIS, which prefers to be deployed near the transmitter or receiver, MF-RISs should be deployed closer to the transmitter for better performance.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:02","2023-09-19 10:30:02","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the passive nature of eavesdroppers and the cascaded channel brought by the RIS, the channel state information (CSI) is imperfectly obtained at the base station, leading to uncertain CSI. Under channel uncertainty, the optimal phase-shift, power allocation, and transmission rate design for secure transmission is currently unknown due to the difficulty of handling the probabilistic constraint with coupled variables. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the energy efficient secure transmission while incorporating the probabilistic constraint. By transforming the probabilistic constraint and decoupling the variables, the secure energy-efficiency maximization problem can be solved via alternatively executing the concave-convex procedure and penalty-based method. Simulation results show that the proposed RIS-aided secure transmission scheme significantly improves the energy-efficiency compared to baseline schemes of random phase-shift, fixed phase-shift, and RIS ignoring CSI uncertainty.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:03","2023-09-19 10:30:03","","4637-4642","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information sharing plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of the supply chain, and datasheets are the most common data format to describe e-component commodities in the ICT supply chain because of human readability. However, with the surging number of electronic documents, it has been far beyond the capacity of human readers, and it is also challenging to process tabular data automatically because of the complex table structures and heterogeneous layouts.

In this paper, we formulate TSR as an object detection problem and propose to generate an intuitive representation of a complex table structure to enable structuring of the tabular data related to the commodities. To cope with border-less and small layouts, we propose a cost-sensitive loss function by considering the detection difficulty of each class. Besides, we propose a novel anchor generation method using the character of tables that columns in a table should share an identical height, and rows in a table should share the same width.

Existing routing strategies perform in a distributed manner on single-layer networks. But they suffer from the delay of information update in highly dynamic LSNs, which encounter unstable laser links and uneven traffic distribution problems. In this paper, we first propose a multi-layer LSN architecture. It is composed of a routing layer with high-orbit satellites for routing planning and a forwarding layer with low-orbit satellites for data transmitting. A centralized multi-layer optical routing strategy is further designed, namely CMOR. It is expected to provide the data forwarding plan depending on the global view of the routing layer on real-time laser link status and traffic loads of the forwarding layer. Compared with single-layer distributed routing, CMOR is proven to have a lower packet loss rate and transmission latency with large-scale satellite simulations.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:07","2023-09-19 10:30:07","","4673-4678","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the existing literature, the satellite and terrestrial networks are assumed to be naturally willing to cooperate with each other to improve the performance of the entire CSTN system. However, these two networks generally belong to different authorities in practice and will not cooperate if their own benefits are impaired. From this perspective, we propose a Stackelberg game based secure transmission strategy for the CSTN to motivate cooperation, where the satellite network acts as the leader and the terrestrial network acts as the follower. Specifically, we model the utility function of the satellite network as the secrecy rate assisted by the terrestrial network. Moreover, the utility function of the terrestrial network is modeled as its obtained transmission rate discounted by the cost of total transmission energy. On this basis, we adopt the backward induction method to determine the Stackelberg equilibrium, from which both the utilities of the satellite and terrestrial networks are maximized. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate our theoretical results.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:07","2023-09-19 10:30:07","","01-06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is worth noting that congestion is extremely destructive to the network, causing the network's overall performance to decline and even crashes and paralysis in severe cases. Therefore, timely identification and dealing with the network congestion are hot and difficult points of current research. Currently, most works (i.e., the active and passive measurement) identify the congestion on the node level, which may cause impractical issues with the increasing number of nodes (i.e., increasing detection probes will exacerbate the network congestion). To this end, this paper innovatively develops an active detection method based on the improved ant colony algorithm (IAC) for congestion identification on the path level. The developed method uses the IAC algorithm to find the optimal path and identifies the congested path by comparing the optimal path before and after congestion. Besides, the queuing theory model is utilized to obtain the performance metrics (i.e., queuing waiting time) to evaluate the optimal path. Experimental results show that the developed method can accurately identify the congested path in the network. This method makes identifying congestion less expensive and has higher operational feasibility, which is meaningful for the practical reference.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:08","2023-09-19 10:30:08","","4685-4690","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, we construct the transmission rate and time division multiple access scheduling model to describe the inter-satellite link, and the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduling model for wired link respectively. Secondly, we analyze the influence of the position of packet in different time slots on the forwarding delay, to model the relationship between the converged scheduling and forwarding delay.

This large-scale net-working effectively improves network coverage and capacity. However, denser satellite deployment brings more severe chal-lenges to satellite handovers, such as frequent handovers, which exponentially reduce the system performance (e.g. probability of service success (PSS)) when considering inherent handover failures. To ensure service continuity, this paper focuses on the relationship between the constellation scale and handover times under seamless coverage. Specifically, we first conduct spatial geometric analysis and probabilistic analysis to derive three new conditions for MLSC seamless coverage. Then, we analyze the tradeoff relationships between the handover times and satellite coverage duration with the given constellation scale. Furthermore, we construct a mathematical relationship between the constellation scale, handover times, and PSS, indicating the tradeoff between constellation scale and system performance. The analysis effectively guides to design or adjust the constellation scale, satellite altitude, satellite coverage angle, and handover strategy according to the requirements of system performance, which has important theoretical value for MLSC system design and future research.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:08","2023-09-19 10:30:08","","4697-4702","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The network consists of two parts: first, it uses CNN to extract the latent features of the occupancy state of multi-channel and multi-slot; then, it uses the latent features of the spectrum occupancy state to predict occupancy state through the memory property of LSTM. Experiments show that the network model designed in this paper can achieve comparable performance to the LSTM network in short-term spectrum prediction. In the long-term spectrum prediction, MTF2N is more accurate than LSTM, Seq2seq and GRU networks since MTF2N integrates more channel and time slot correlation features.

However, at present, data is starting to hinder ML's development. The first reason is that the privacy of data is increasingly valued by the public. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged, which realizes model training through distributed computing and centralized aggregation. Second, due to the popularity of FL, edge devices need to store all data, which may quickly occupy the entire storage space of edge devices, resulting in fatal errors. To address these challenges, we proposed a storage-aware joint user scheduling and spectrum allocation algorithm, named FedSUS, to reduce the storage stress of each device and guarantee traditional FL metrics, i.e., learning accuracy and training latency. First, a probabilistic framework is adopted for user scheduling. Second, we introduce a data influence evaluation method to FL and analyze its convergence. Based on this, two problems are formulated to tradeoff the storage resource, the influence of data, and the learning latency and to minimize the transmission latency, respectively. Then, the closed-form results to the above problems are both developed. Finally, FedSUS is validated by using a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) and datasets (CIFAR-10).

However, the performance of FL is greatly restricted by the limited network communication capacity between the cloud and clients. MEC-assisted Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) can effectively relieve the network pressure in FL, by transmitting and aggregating model parameters at the network edge based on the idea of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). The existing researches on HFL often adopt the traditional multiple access techniques (e.g., OFDMA) for the model transmission between clients and edge servers, which may be inefficient. In this work, we consider a novel Over-the-Air Computing (AirComp) based HFL framework, where clients send model parameters to edge servers simultaneously, and edge servers can directly complete the aggregation of model in the air by exploiting the superposition property of wireless channels. In such a scenario, we study the joint client association, transmission, and computation optimization problem, aiming at minimizing the overall energy consumption and latency. The problem is challenging due to the multi-level coupling between edge servers and clients. We decouple it into a client association subproblem and a resource optimization subproblem. We first show that the second subproblem is convex and can be easily solved by a coordinate descent algorithm. We then show that the first subproblem is a combinational optimization, and propose a near-optimal solution where each client is associated with the nearest edge server. Simulation results show that the AirComp-based HFL scheme outperforms the existing OFDMA-based schemes in terms of both energy consumption and latency.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:10","2023-09-19 10:30:10","","4728-4733","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present a cross-layer mechanism referred to as the buffer-aware variable-blocklength coding to minimize the average delay of bursty traffics. To optimize and analyze the buffer-aware short packet transmission, we formulate a tandem queue model consisting of both the packet queue buffering bits to be encoded and the symbol queue buffering coded symbols to be sent. By deriving the transition probability matrix and the steady state probability of the two-dimensional Markov chain characterizing the tandem queue, we obtain the average latency as a function of the arrival rate and transmission power.

This work investigates the performance of treating interference as noise and joint decoding schemes in two-user Gaussian Z-interference channel under finite blocklength coding regime. The average error and throughput of the two-user Z-interference channel are characterized for different schemes in a Rayleigh fading scenario. However, the average throughput does not take account of the bursty nature of the data arrivals at the users. Thus, we consider the stability region as a metric, and it is characterized using the probability of successful decoding at the receivers. The average error developed for the different interference mitigation techniques under the finite blocklength coding help to obtain the stability region. A main takeaway message is that even for the weak interference regime, the joint decoding scheme can perform better than the treating interference as noise scheme for low rates.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:12","2023-09-19 10:30:12","","4746-4751","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this problem, in this paper, two sets of measurement campaigns are conducted in a data center scenario at 130–140 GHz band, by using a vector network analyzer (VNA)-based channel sounder system with different receiver heights. The measured data is further processed to extract the multi path components (MPCs) and classify the MPCs into clusters. Furthermore, the channel characteristics, including the path loss, shadow fading, K-factor, delay and angular spreads are calculated and analyzed. Clustering results and MPCs propagation are analyzed and examined in light of the real geometry in the data center. Interestingly, comparison with measured results in meeting room scenarios at 140 GHz shows that the reflections and scattering from metal racks in the data center are more significant, resulting in lower path loss, smaller K-factor, and larger delay spreads.

A fundamental limitation on wireless communication within the box is thermal noise. Under conditions of thermal equilibrium the Equipartition Theorem of classical statistical mechanics states that every orthogonal normal mode has an independent random amplitude such that the expected energies of the modes are equal and proportional to absolute temperature. Collectively the randomly excited modes constitute a space-time stochastic process, station-ary in time but non-stationary in space because of boundary conditions. As the linear dimensions of the box grow relative to a wavelength the process is asymptotically stationary. At each temporal frequency the wavenumber spectral density is identical to that of the Clarke model - a superposition of random plane waves having no preferred direction of propagation. At a single point in space the spectral density is proportional to the square of temporal frequency - the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum.

The deployment of new components within the heart of the radio access network calls for expedient tools that assist and ensure their optimal placement within the existing network infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce metrics that can characterize indoor wireless network performance (IWNP) in terms of coverage and capacity, and we evaluate them via physics-based propagation models. In particular, we exploit a deterministic propagation model, i.e., a ray-tracer, as well as a novel machine learning-based propagation model. We demonstrate that data-driven propagation models can be leveraged for the rigorous evaluation of the IWNP metrics, yielding a remarkable computational efficiency compared to the conventional deterministic models. The use of physics-based site-specific propagation models allows for the particularities of each indoor geometry to be taken into account, and also makes feasible the consideration of uncertainties related to the indoor environment.

In particular, we employ an ISAC design to sense stochastic events, through which an aperiodic traffic is generated. The event-triggered aperiodic traffic is next scheduled with a periodic traffic. Meanwhile, the system provides reliability for both periodic and aperiodic traffics within a hard latency constraint. To understand the latency and reliability performance under the joint design, we first describe the sensing and communication processes under a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. Then, we analytically express the two traffics' latency and reliability performance under the joint beamforming and scheduling. Based on the analysis, we formulate an optimal tradeoff between the performance of the periodic and aperiodic traffics, and obtain it by a Dynamic Programming (DP)-based algorithm.

It is widely perceived that these requirements represent the conditions under which the two peering networks perceive a roughly equal exchange of value. However, the academic literature has not yet shown the relationship between these settlement-free peering requirements and the value to each interconnecting network. We analyze the value to each network from the most common and important requirements. Large ISPs often require potential settlement-free peers to interconnect at a minimum of 6–8 locations from a predetermined list. We find that there is a substantial benefit from this requirement to the ISP, but little incremental benefit from a larger number of interconnection points. Large ISPs often require that the ratio of incoming traffic to outgoing traffic remain below approximately 2:1.

In an experimental pseudo setting, we propose a routing method DRL-MPR (Multi-Plane Routing) within a Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN) framework as a controller in which by simultaneously allocating multiple robust IP sessions, each session will take the near optimal path/plane. We first revisit Multi-Plane Routing Protocol (MPR) to configure a set of routing paths/Routing Planes (RP) from a physical topology as pre-condition ahead of the traffic injection. We compare our decision making scheme results with some traditional routing methodologies such as OSPF and standard Multi-Plane Routing (MPR). Our simulation results show that DRL obtains lower maximum link utilisation (MLU) and end-to-end delay. For example, in the 19 nodes and 41 links topology, a small traffic load results in 60% maximum link utilisation for DRL-MPR, whereas those of OSPF and MPR are 100% and 94% respectively.

First, we formulate the issue as an optimization problem aiming to maximize the minimum transmission rate of the served IoT devices during the UAV-BS replacement process. This is translated into jointly optimizing the trajectory of the source UAV-BS (the one to be replaced) and the target UAV-BS (the replacing one), while pushing the IoT devices to seamlessly transfer their connections to the target UAV-BS. We therefore consider a target replacement zone where the UAV-BS replacement can happen, along with IoT connections transfer. Furthermore, we propose a solution based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). More precisely, we introduce a Multi-Heterogeneous Agent-based approach (MHA-DRL), where two types of agents are considered, namely the UAV-BS agents and the IoT agents. Each agent implements a DQN (Deep Q-Learning) algorithm, where UAV-BS agents learn optimal policies to perform replacement while IoT agents learn optimal policies to transfer their connections to the target UAV-BS.

To deal with above problem, we propose a novel URLLC preemptive strategy, where the arriving URLLC services could cross through multiple mini-slots rather than only one to puncture resources on demand. With the proposed strategy, considering the heterogeneous delay requirements of URLLC services and the preemptive influence on eMBB services, an efficient algorithm based on optimized sparrow search is also proposed. Through allocating time and frequency resources occupied by each URLLC service on de-mand, the number of URLLC services supported by the gNB is maximized while the satisfaction of eMBB services is ensured.

Although many researchers have investigated how the heterogeneous service function chain (SFC) requests can interact with the MEC system, very few have tackled how to deploy a flexible MEC infrastructure at the mobile operator for the expected mobile traffic. This paper addresses the design and dimensioning of an agile MEC infrastructure problem with aid of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology. To improve physical resource utilization, we consider virtual instances resources overheads and virtual instances shareability in the deployment process. A mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) is used to construct a physical MEC system design by mapping the received SFCs' virtual networks to the dimensioned MEC nodes while minimizing the deployment cost. Numerical results highlight the value gained in reducing the deployment cost while guaranteeing the delay requirements for different SFCs with high acceptance rates.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:38","2023-09-19 10:30:38","","3670-3675","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the key rate achievable over a weak quantum signal is limited by the link performance (e.g., loss and noise) and propagation distance, especially in multi-node QKD networks, making it necessary to design a scheme to efficiently and timely distribute keys to the various nodes. In this work, we formulate, using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, a novel Routing, Channel, and Key-rate Assignment (RCKA) problem for QKD with Quantum Key Pool (QKP), which exploits the opportunity of using trusted relays and optical bypass. Our formulation accounts for the possibility to build a quantum key distribution path that combines both quantum channels and trusted relays to increase the acceptance ratio of key rate requests. Leveraging different versions of the proposed MILP model, we evaluate several strategies exploiting different combinations of trusted relays and optical bypass for the RCKA problem. Results show how different trade-offs between security and resource-efficiency (expressed in terms of acceptance ratio of key rate requests vs. key storing rate in QKP) can be achieved when adopting trusted-relay and/or optical-bypass technologies. Trusted relays can provide a higher acceptance ratio when the number of QKD modules (transmitters or receivers) is sufficiently large, while optical bypass, which does not require the implementation of expensive trusted relays, is preferable when the number of QKD modules is a limiting factor.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:39","2023-09-19 10:30:39","","3676-3681","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the main challenges of dynamic, resource-efficient Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) is spectrum fragmentation. Fragmented, stranded spectrum slots lead to poor resource utilization and increase the blocking probability of in-coming service requests. Conventional approaches for Spectrum Defragmentation (SD) apply various criteria to decide when, and which portion of the spectrum to defragment. However, these polices often address only a subset of tasks related to defragmentation, are not adaptable, and have limited automation potential. To address these issues, we propose DeepDefrag, a novel framework based on reinforcement learning that addresses the main aspects of the SD process: determining when to perform de-fragmentation, which connections to reconfigure, and which part of the spectrum to reallocate them to. DeepDefrag outperforms the well-known Older-First First-Fit (OF-FF) defragmentation heuristic, achieving lower blocking probability under smaller defragmentation overhead.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:40","2023-09-19 10:30:40","","3694-3699","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These solutions should also ensure backward compatibility with existing network architectures. A cost-effective technical solution for today's metro networks consists in optimizing the deployment cost of hierarchical traffic-grooming boards while considering a mix of coherent (typically 100 Gbps) and non-coherent (typically 10 Gbps) transmission technologies. In this study, we consider metro regional networks composed of interconnected filterless rings, and we investigate how to minimize the joint cost of stacked Optical Transport Network (OTN) traffic-grooming boards, coherent and non-coherent transponders and interfaces, and Dispersion Compensation Modules (DCM). We propose a novel optimization approach based on Genetic Algorithms to effectively solve the associated grooming problem and compare its performance to baseline strategies, showing that we can reach up to 79% cost savings in terms of the total cost of deployed equipment.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:40","2023-09-19 10:30:40","","3700-3705","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assess this possibility in the context of an integrated TN-NTN, comprising a ground cellular deployment paired with a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, providing sub-6 GHz connectivity to an urban area populated by ground users (GUEs) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our study reveals that offloading UAV traffic to the NTN segment drastically reduces the downlink outage of UAVs from 70% to nearly zero, also boosting their uplink signal quality as long as the LEO satellite constellation is sufficiently dense to guarantee a minimum elevation angle. Offloading UAVs to the NTN also benefits coexisting GUEs, preventing uplink outages of around 12% that GUEs would otherwise incur. Despite the limited bandwidth available below 6 GHz, NTN-offloaded UAVs meet command and control rate requirements even across an area the size of Barcelona with as many as one active UAV per cell. Smaller UAV populations yield proportionally higher rates, potentially enabling aerial broadband applications.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:41","2023-09-19 10:30:41","","3706-3711","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A local and web remote monitoring and control system is developed through the design of a ground control station (GCS) for a pre-planned autonomous trajectory flight. Then, two autonomously guided and coordinated UAVs are built and used to transport a payload to a remote area where the target way points are selected on the GCS interface by the user and the mission is monitored in real time. A custom communication protocol is implemented to use one UAV as a relay between the GCS and the second UAV. Cable material payload delivery for bridge construction is selected as a case study in real-world experiments conducted at the Virginia Tech's Drone Park. The experimental results thoroughly evaluate the performance of the implemented UAV delivery system. In particular, the experiments related to the flight missions were successful after several tests and adjustments.

The key novelty yet challenge is to exploit the predicted channel knowledge among the UAVs to optimize the transmission strategy. Much prior work focuses on multi-UAV cooperation from a centralized perspective, or in a distributed manner but requiring intensive message exchange. This paper develops a team strategy following a game-theoretical approach, where the data packets are passed from one node to the other according to the handover time that is negotiated in a fully distributive way. A Handover Game is thus formulated and is proven that the Nash equilibriums (NEs) are the stationary points of an energy minimization problem for coordinated data transportation. A neighbor coordinate response strategy is designed, which is shown to converge faster than a classical asynchronous response in a multi-player game.

In the field of autonomous driving (a.k.a., auto-driving), the centralized vehicle-to-everything (V2X) system depends heavily on the stability of the central node, and there is seldom a mechanism to guarantee the security, stability and timeliness of information in highly dynamic auto-driving scenarios. In this paper, we first design and implement the AIR-RAFT system that supports wireless distributed consensus for IoT. AIR-RAFT is a complete embedded system based on the Raft consensus algorithm and can be potentially installed on auto-driving vehicles. It can not only achieve wireless consensus to ensure the consistency and security of V2X data but also can synchronize the actions among the vehicles in a distributed manner though all cars are not trusted each other. In addition, we originally propose the “selective edge decision layer” for the AIR-RAFT system which can share part of the decision privilege in auto-driving cars. In practical performance evaluations, the AIR-RAFT based auto-driving vehicles stably achieve multi-node (3–7) wireless data consensus and actions synchronization that maintain good working stability within 350 m centered on the leader.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:42","2023-09-19 10:30:42","","3736-3741","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing regional sales prediction solutions focus on utilizing single-source temporal features (e.g., date types and historical sales data) to conduct time-series forecasting, which have not yet modeled the correlations of features among intra and inter regions explicitly (e.g., the regional population, age structure, sex ratio, and spatial correlations of multi-regions).

Specifically, the Intra- and Inter-region features are first encoded by the graph convolutional network (GCN), which simultaneously considers static features and contextual information of similar regions during the encoding process. Then, we design a transformer-based model to conduct sales prediction considering both Intra- and Inter-region features embeddings and long-term temporal features.

However, it is usually difficult to achieve satisfactory water demand prediction due to the differences in the characteristics of different water use regions and the limitation of sampling frequency caused by the power consumption control of Internet-of-Things (IoT) data sampling terminals. In this paper, a transfer learning prediction model is proposed by combining the multi-head attention mechanism. Firstly, the attention features are extracted from the water demand of the source domain and the target domain simultaneously by the encoder, and then the maximum mean difference is adopted to make the features of the source domain match the feature distribution of the target domain. Finally, the decoder infers the predicted value based on the multi-head attention mechanism. During the training process of the model, the overall loss function is used to continuously reduce the error between the predicted value and the actual value. We compare the proposed model with other representative models on the real datasets of a water supply company, and the experimental results show that the proposed model reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by about 50% and about 30%, respectively. It reflects that the model proposed in this paper can achieve a more accurate prediction of the water demand of the divided regional water supply cities.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:43","2023-09-19 10:30:43","","3760-3765","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, joint ECC-RAID schemes have been proposed for the reliability of SSD. Especially, due to high reliability with low computational complexity, joint ECC-RAID schemes based on RAID-5, denoted as ECC-RAID-5, are popularly adopted to devices as well as systems of data storage. In this paper, a new family of joint ECC-RAID schemes, called ECC-aided RAID (EA-RAID), are proposed to further improve the reliability of the joint ECC-RAID schemes in the data storage applications. In the EA-RAID, new types of data checking and regenerating algorithms based on soft-decision (SD) are introduced to enhance the error-correcting capability of the cooperative ECC decoding. The EA-RAID increases error-correction capability as at least 15% and 7% gain compared with the ECC-only schemes and the conventional ECC-RAID-5, respectively. The improvement is demonstrated by productized SSD based on virtuaI3-bit-over multi-level cell (MLC) NAND. It is expected that the proposed technologies can be introduced as a potential solution for next generation NAND.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:44","2023-09-19 10:30:44","","3772-3778","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such a new field considers network traffic from IoT devices as possible source of evidence for forensic investigations. However, the massive amount of IoT devices and traffic produced makes storage challenging, especially when this is performed on limited-resource edge devices such as e.g., WiFi access points. This paper proposes a framework to optimize the storage-accuracy trade-offs of IoT forensic analysis tasks. The goal of the framework is to find the optimal working point in terms of number of features to extract from network traffic and the number of bits used for quantizing each feature, in order to maximize the IoT forensic task accuracy under storage constraints. After presenting the framework, we validate it over two different IoT forensics tasks: IoT device identification and activity recognition from encrypted traffic of IoT cameras. Results show that with low effort it is possible to find the optimal settings to operate to maximize the analysis accuracy under given storage limitations.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:44","2023-09-19 10:30:44","","3779-3784","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we explore a new function named “keyword diverting” and propose a variant of SSE named Divertible Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DivSSE). Specifically, the index in DivSSE is encoded into an inverted, compressed, and encrypted format, by using the super-increasing sequence, symmetric homomorphic encryption (SHE), and a secure hash function. According to the homomorphic properties of SHE, users can construct a unique keyword diverting token, which can be utilized to update the encrypted index by obliviously merging data identifiers corresponding to different keywords without searching in advance and thus achieve keyword diverting. Moreover, based on function secret sharing, DivSSE can protect users' search patterns and reduce communication costs with the assistance of two independent clouds. Detailed security proof demonstrates that DivSSE can achieve parallel privacy, forward privacy, and backward privacy. Extensive performance evaluation also shows that DivSSE is efficient in terms of computational and communication overheads.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:44","2023-09-19 10:30:44","","3785-3790","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although fine-grained access control adapts to complex scenarios, it is not necessary anytime and may cause heavy costs over computation in SSE schemes. Moreover, it is crucial to support documents updating and forward privacy. To combat that, we design a multi-client SSE scheme with efficient access control over dynamic encrypted documents.

The analog beamformer will suppress the SI to the level that the residual SI can be completely removed with digital SI cancellation, allowing the digital beamformer to concentrate on the desired channel, free of the SI.

A surge in the number of connected devices results in a stringent requirement for multiple access. To meet this challenge, a beamforming scheme in a downlink multiple-input and single-output (MISO) transmission is investigated, where an overloaded base station (BS) is committed to serving every user. Due to the deficiency of the number of antennas, the overload user equipment (OUE) needs to ride on an existing beam to connect to the BS. The optimization goal in this work is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system by joint optimizing for the selection of the shared beam and power allocation, subject to a constraint of the total power allocated to each beam. To tackle the formulated problem, a proximal policy optimization (PPO) based solution is proposed for jointly determining the beam choice and power allocation.

This mechanism is embedded in the admission control (AC) of an access node (AN) and uses Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-based resource budget prediction while admitting new connection requests to the network. The goal is to maximize the number of clients admitted into the system while maintaining the reliability of the previously admitted critical connections. Our simulation-based evaluations highlight that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline approach - not featuring ML - by about 17% in terms of the average per-session reliability of safety-critical connections at different network load conditions, and hence, provide further evidence on the potentials of ML for next-generation networks design.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:48","2023-09-19 10:30:48","","3851-3856","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, it is desired to perform flow placements strategically considering application requirements due to limited resource availability. In this paper, path computation for time-sensitive networks is investigated while satisfying individual end-to-end delay requirements of critical traffic. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) which is NP-hard with exponentially increasing computational complexity as the network size expands. To solve the MILP with high efficiency, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that learns the best routing policy by continuously interacting with the network environment. The proposed learning algorithm determines the variable action set at each decision-making state and captures different execution times of the actions.

As a variant of federated learning, federated transfer learning utilizes the knowledge from similar tasks and thus has also been intensively studied. However, due to the limited radio spectrum, the communication efficiency of federated learning via wireless links is critical since some tasks may require thousands of Terabytes of uplink payload. In order to improve the communication efficiency, we in this paper propose the feature-based federated transfer learning as an innovative approach to reduce the uplink payload by more than five orders of magnitude compared to that of existing approaches. We first introduce the system design in which the extracted features and outputs are uploaded instead of parameter updates, and then determine the required payload with this approach and provide comparisons with the existing approaches. Subsequently, we analyze the random shuffling scheme that preserves the clients' privacy. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed learning scheme via experiments on an image classification task to show its effectiveness.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:49","2023-09-19 10:30:49","","3875-3880","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To deal with this problem, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that modifies the wireless channel through intelligent signal reflection has gained much attention recently. In this paper, we propose an efficient near-field RIS-assisted wideband THz channel estimation scheme. Key idea of the proposed scheme, referred to as the polar-domain frequency-dependent RIS-assisted channel estimation (PF -RCE), is to exploit the polar-domain sparsity of the near-field channel and common support property of the wideband THz channel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates the characteristics of RIS-assisted wideband THz channel in the near- filed region and provides an efficient channel estimation scheme. From the numerical evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed PF-RCE scheme achieves a significant performance gain over the conventional THz channel estimation schemes in terms of the normalized mean square error (NMSE).","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:49","2023-09-19 10:30:49","","3893-3898","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the dynamic channel condition and energy feeding greatly influence the network status, cooperative resource scheduling should be adaptive to the future environmental fluctuation. In this paper, we model the cooperative resource scheduling problem in STNs as a resource limited Markov Decision Process (MDP). Considering the fact that satellites are unaware of future environmental status, the traditional static optimization solution is infeasible. Therefore, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based Cooperative Store-and-Relay Resource Scheduling Algorithm (CSR-RSA), where inter-satellite links are utilized to coordinate with intermittent satellite-ground links for improving the transmission performance of the network. By exploiting the proposed CSR-RSA, the well-trained neural networks can be obtained to generate the adaptive and cooperative resource scheduling strategy without the knowledge of future environmental status.

Satellites integrated with 5G and beyond are pivotal to achieve global coverage, reliable and continuing service access, with the booming low-orbit satellite (LEO) constellations. While previous works largely focus on rural or remote areas, the orbiting satellites cover the ground evenly. This paper is then interested in unserved or underserved users in urban hotspots arising from large-scale access. Under the large delay of the ground-to-satellite link and the dynamic characteristic of satellites, we propose a satellite-terrestrial cooperative, geographical dispersed and regional centralized batch access control scheme. A data-driven QoS indicator, responsivity, is proposed to complement the semi-online batch scheme from a network perspective. It combines subsiding access control from LEO satellite to ground with LEO satellite resources to provide auxiliary access for higher responsivity users relatively. We model the on-demand batch access mechanism as a multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) solved by a hybrid genetic algorithm. Collectively, the cooperative batch mechanisms compress signaling transmission and reduce optional power consumption. Simulation results show that the new indicator achieves a better balance between spectral efficiency and global OoS compared to existing methods.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:52","2023-09-19 10:30:52","","3929-3934","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different to current literature on seamless coverage of HTS which considers that the shapes of multi-spot beam coverage regions are regular, this paper considers a practical HTS system, in which the multi-spot beams with irregular coverage regions are discussed, and the limitations of spot beam resource and coverage overlapping are taken into account. In order to achieve efficient seamless coverage of HTS, a grid division based multi-spot beam footprint planning (GD-MBFP) scheme is proposed with a given maximum coverage overlap ratio, aiming to minimize the number of spot beams. Meanwhile, for GD-MBFP scheme, a grid division based singlespot beam coverage calculation (GD-SBCC) method is proposed to obtain the irregular coverage regions of spot beams accurately. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed GD-MBFP scheme.

However, current deep JSCC image transmission systems are typically optimized for traditional distortion metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM). But for low transmission rates, due to the imperfect wireless channel, these distortion metrics lose significance as they favor pixel-wise preservation. To account for human visual perception in semantic communications, it is of great importance to develop new deep JSCC systems optimized beyond traditional PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics. In this paper, we introduce adversarial losses to optimize deep JSCC, which tends to preserve global semantic information and local texture. Our new deep JSCC architecture combines encoder, wireless channel, decoder/generator, and discriminator, which are jointly learned under both perceptual and adversarial losses. Our method yields human visually much more pleasing results than state-of-the-art engineered image coded transmission systems and traditional deep JSCC systems. A user study confirms that achieving perceptually similar end-to-end image transmission quality, the proposed method can save about 50% wireless channel bandwidth costs.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:53","2023-09-19 10:30:53","","3959-3964","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, we firstly propose a unified deep learning enabled semantic communication system (U-DeepSC), where a unified model is developed to serve various transmission tasks. To jointly serve these tasks in one model with fixed parameters, we employ domain adaptation in the training procedure to specify the task-specific features for each task. Thus, the system only needs to transmit the task-specific features, rather than all the features, to reduce the transmission overhead. Moreover, since each task is of different difficulty and requires different number of layers to achieve satisfactory performance, we develop the multi-exit architecture to provide early-exit results for relatively simple tasks. In the experiments, we employ a proposed U-DeepSC to serve five tasks with multi-modalities.

The key technique employed by Flexcatter is signal emulation, where the tag can vary the reflection coefficient in the time domain to emulate desired baseband signals. To meet the low-power requirements of Flexcatter, we first carefully design a cost-effective impedance network, which can provide up to 16 reflection coefficients for different signal amplitudes and phases. Moreover, we present an effective emulation strategy for desired baseband signals. Next, we introduce the oversampling method in the baseband modulation pipeline to mitigate the effect of emulation errors caused by hardware deficiency. We further build the prototype hardware, including an FPGA platform and the radio frequency (RF) module. Experiment results show that OFDM transmissions from Flexcatter can achieve a throughput of 21.1 Mbps at the backscatter range of 12 m. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate OFDM transmission with 64 subcarriers using low-power RF switches.

Most of the existing works assume that each primary channel is associated with a constant idle probability, which can be accurately estimated by sensing the channel multiple times. However, due to the rapid traffic change and irregular user mobility, primary channels can be highly dynamic and the associated idle probability is generally time-varying. In this paper, we consider DSA in non-stationary environments where the idle probabilities of primary channels vary with time.

Then, the RIS phase-shift matrix is iteratively optimized to maximize the sum of eigenvalues of the correlation matrix of the weakest user. Thereby, a maximal ratio transmission based precoder is designed by using the estimated composite channel together with the statistical CSI based optimal phase-shift matrix for the downlink payload transmission. Via the worst-case Gaussian technique, the downlink achievable user rates are derived in closed-form for correlated Rayleigh fading in the presence of imperfect CSI.

For the design of NF localization to be effective, signals reflected on distinct RIS points should be profiled without interfering with the others, called signal classification (SC). In this paper, we propose a simple yet novel SC technique, called linear phase modulation (LPM), where sequences of distant RIS elements' phases are linearly modulated with different rates. Along with the conventional or-thogonal frequency division multiplexing waveform, LPM makes it possible to classify the reflected signals by distant RIS elements as well as estimate their propagation distances using a two-dimensional Fourier transform (2D-FT) technique. It exploits one more signal dimension for performance improvement than conventional one-dimensional FT (1D-FT) based SC. Through analytic and numerical studies, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed SC using LPM by comparing its localization accuracy with several benchmarks designed based on 1D-FT.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:58","2023-09-19 10:30:58","","4013-4019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also provide a simpler approximate closed-form expression for the SOP in order to understand the effect of system parameters on the performance and to find the optimal power allocation for the transmitter and jammer. The optimal transmit and jamming power allocation factor is derived by minimizing the SOP assuming a total power constraint.

This study focuses on Standalone-IRS (SA- IRS), a device that can autonomously estimate and control its environment. SA-IRS is independent of existing communication systems and has the ability to collect the necessary information to exert control by itself. Therefore, it does not need to be connected to other devices for control, and is expected to be used as a low- installation-cost device for improving the propagation environment for small-scale communications, such as in factories using local 5G. Basically, the control of IRSs requires Channel State Information (CSI) to understand the propagation environment. However, because an IRS is a passive device that cannot transmit or receive information, CSI estimated from the difference of transmitted and received signals is not available for SA-IRS. This motivated us to propose an SA-IRS codebook that links IRS control to user location information to control IRS without CSI. In addition, because of the overhead involved in calculating the linked IRS control, which is an element of the SA-IRS codebook, we propose an efficient SA-IRS codebook construction method. The objective of this research is to efficiently control SA-IRS, which is an IRS with low installation cost, and to ensure high communication quality by using the above-mentioned proposed method. Simulations are also conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:30:59","2023-09-19 10:30:59","","01-06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the distributed IRS set-up regains its dominance when the channel phases are perfectly estimated and even for the case of discrete phase-shift adjustments with quantization errors. In this context, the outage performance of the best IRS selection is investigated and compared against the distributed IRS scheme with phase-shift errors. The best IRS selection criterion is designed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by jointly optimizing the phase-shifts of passive reflecting elements at the best IRS. The end-to-end SNR for the Nakagami-m fading is statistically characterized by deriving a tight approximation to the cumulative distribution function in the presence of phase-shift errors at the IRSs.

From the extensive study of physical layer security schemes, we have observed that there is a knowledge gap regarding certain security principles practiced by cryptographers and the experts within physical layer security, causing many physical layer security schemes to be impractical for standardization and the wide-scale integration into information and communication technologies. This paper describes a variety of security principles and concepts, practiced by cryptographers, and of importance to physical layer security experts.

The main advantage of this approach lies in its flexible integration into the lower layers of the 5G NR protocol stack without affecting the communication's reliability.

It allows the extraction of secret keys using the channel randomness observed at the physical layer, without a centralized key distribution server. In this work an SKG approach suitable for wideband IoT devices is proposed. We investigate a filterbank-based SKG method, in which secret bits are generated through power measurements over different frequencies. To minimize dependencies and correlation among frequencies the quantile and the Karhunen-Loeve transforms are used. Finally, we perform a numerical evaluation of the achievable SKG rates, in the form of mutual-information (MI) estimates, using 3GPP channel models.

We first extract the JLFS-based feature by solving a low-rank maximum likelihood factor analysis problem with sparsity constraint, and then perform the AJ-UM detection in a sequential manner. Moreover, the proposed JLFS-based method does not need to know the accurate prior information of the JLFS-based feature in the presence or absence of the AJ-UM, which can determine the AJ-UM exists as long as there is an abrupt change in the JLFS-based feature.

In JCS networks, scheduling in the MAC layer is needed to balance the tasks of delivering data packets (particularly when there are multiple hops) and the radar target sensing, given limited wireless resources. In this paper, a unified framework is proposed, by considering virtual queues, in which virtual information bits for sensing that characterize the uncertainties of the mobile radar targets are backlogged if sensing is not carried out, or are cleared if significant resource is dedicated to sensing. The entropy reduction by sensing and entropy accumulation due to random perturbations to the radar target motions are quantified using the framework of Kalman filtering. Then the back pressure scheduling is employed for both the real communication queues and virtual sensing queues. Both JCS schemes of simple time-division multiplexing (TDM) and more flexible coding-spreading multiplexing (CSM) are taken into account.

We investigate the fundamental tradeoff between the estimation Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for sensing and the data rate for communication, by characterizing the Pareto boundary of the achievable CRB-rate (C-R) region. Towards this end, we formulate a new MIMO rate maximization problem by optimizing the transmit covariance matrix at the BS, subject to a new form of maximum CRB constraint together with a maximum transmit power constraint. We derive the optimal transmit covariance solution in a semi-closed form, by first implementing the singular-value decomposition (SVD) to diagonalize the communication channel and then properly allocating the transmit power over these subchannels for communication and other orthogonal subchannels (if any) for dedicated sensing. It is shown that the optimal transmit covariance is of full rank, which unifies the conventional rate maximization design with water-filling power allocation and the CRB minimization design with isotropic transmission.

To perform a sensing task in MCS, appropriate participating users are selected first, and efficient data sensing and transmission policies are then designed for data aggregation. In mobile edge networks, network resource availability affects how to select the participating users, and the bandwidth allocated to a user affects its process of data sensing and transmission. Since user selection, bandwidth allocation, data sensing and transmission are closely coupled issues in a resource constrained MCS system, we focus on designing a joint sensing and communication framework in this paper, by jointly optimizing the aforementioned four policies under resource constraints. Specifically, the optimal data sensing and transmission policies are first derived under a given user selection and bandwidth allocation scheme.

The shadowing by a human body results in significant received power degradation and could occur abruptly and frequently. A shadowing period of hundred milliseconds might interrupt the communication and cause significant data loss, considering the huge bandwidth utilized in mmWave communications. An even longer shadowing period might cause a long-duration link outage. Therefore, a blockage prediction mechanism has to be taken to detect the moving blocker within the vicinity of mmWave links. By detecting the potential blockage as early as possible, a user equipment can anticipate by establishing a new connection and performing beam training with an alternative base station before shadowing happens. This paper proposes an early moving blocker detection mechanism by leveraging an extra guard beam to protect the main communication beam. The guard beam is intended to sense the environment by expanding the field of view of a base station. The blockage can be detected early by observing received signal fluctuation resulting from the blocker's presence within the field of view. We derive a channel model for the pre- shadowing event, design a moving blockage detection algorithm for the guard beam, and evaluate the performance of the guard beam theoretically and experimentally based on the measurement campaign using our mmWave testbed. Our results demonstrate that the guard beam can extend the detection range and predict the blockage up to 360 ms before the shadowing occurs.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:05","2023-09-19 10:31:05","","4093-4098","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 5G User Plane Function (UPF) is an important example of an NFV workload, which enables 5G and internet communications. The UPF has strict packet drop requirements and because user traffic load can vary dramatically throughout the day, the selection of a single static configuration leads to over-provisioning of server resources. To reduce the cost of ownership, network operators can reduce power consumption during periods of low traffic load, but to do so they must ensure that packet drop requirements are met. In this paper we present DPM-NFV, a machine learning based framework that enables dynamic tuning of a real NFV system. Our methodology is composed of two phases: (1) Offline, targeted automated studies use Bayesian Optimization to infer the best configurations for various load levels; (2) Online, a run-time classifier dynamically selects the best configuration for the current load.

This modulation technology, also called “modulation in the air”, leads to the multiplication of the primary and secondary signals. Thus, SR can be modeled as a multiplicative multiple access channel (M-MAC). In this paper, we propose a modulation scheme for such an M-MAC, which consists of two additive parts: the symbol-invariant component used to aid the primary transmission and the symbol-varying component used to deliver STx information. By optimizing these two components, we can strike a balance between the primary and secondary transmissions. Particularly, due to the coupling between these two transmissions in the M-MAC, we focus on the composite signal formed by the primary and secondary signals. Then, we optimize the above two components by maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance as well as minimizing the Hamming distance between the adjacent constellations of the composite signal.

Accordingly, how to optimize the usage of finite battery budget to get the best possible throughput performance is of great importance. This paper aims to address this issue by focusing on a saturated CSMA network. Explicit expressions of maximum energy efficiency and the corresponding optimal backoff parameter with or without throughput constraint are derived. It is revealed that optimizing the energy efficiency leads to throughput performance degradation. With a stringent throughput constraint, the energy efficiency has to be sacrificed. The energy efficiency and the throughput can be optimized at the same time only in special cases, e.g., the network size is large.

The peer-to-peer (P2P) mode of WET brings improved flexibility to the charging process among the devices as they can maintain their mobility while replenishing their battery. Few existing works in P2P-WET unrealistically assume the nodes to be exchanging energy at every opportunity with any other node. Also, energy exchange between the nodes is not bounded by the energy transfer limit in that inter-node meeting duration. In this regard, the parametric heterogeneity (in terms of device's battery capacity and WET hardware) among the nodes also affects the energy transfer bound in each P2P interaction, and thus, may lead to unbalanced network energy distributions. This inherent heterogeneity aspect has not been adequately covered in the P2P-WET literature so far, especially from the point of view of maintaining a balanced energy distribution in the networked population. In this work, we present a Heterogeneity-aware Wireless Energy Transfer (HetWET) method. In contrast to the existing literature, we devise a fine-grained model of wireless energy transfer while considering the parametric heterogeneity of the participating devices. Thereafter, we enable the nodes to explore and dynamically decide the peers for energy exchange. The performance of HetWET is evaluated using extensive simulations with varying heterogeneity settings. The evaluation results demonstrate that HetWET can maintain lower energy losses and achieve more balanced energy variation distance compared to three different state-of-the-art methods.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:07","2023-09-19 10:31:07","","4123-4128","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most IoT devices employ weak or no encryption at all due to constrained onboard resources, prohibitive manufacturing costs, and challenges due to implementing and managing encryption at scale. Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) is an approach intended to address the security risks associated with unencrypted or weakly encrypted IoT deployments. SEI passively exploits inherent, unintentional waveform features that are imparted during normal device operations, thus it does not require modification of the device being identified. Recently, Deep Learning (DL)-based SEI has garnered a lot of interest due to its ability to learn discriminatory features directly from an emitter's digitally sampled waveforms, thus eliminating feature engineering commonly associated with SEI. DL-based SEI uses the entirety of the digitally sampled waveform, which includes the unintentional as well as intentional waveform structure. The intentional waveform structure does not convey emitter specific features, thus it is information not used by the DL-based SEI process. In fact, this work shows that the intentional waveform structure acts as a confuser that inhibits the DL network's ability to learn the features needed to discern one emitter from another and its negative impacts worsen as the number of emitters increases. Our work shows that frequency-domain removal of the intentional waveform structure coupled with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) results in superior SEI performance.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:07","2023-09-19 10:31:07","","4129-4135","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To provide fair and effective coexistence in shared frequency bands, both technologies rely on carrier sensing. However, differences in sensing thresholds creates an unfair advantage for 5G nodes who access the shared wireless medium more aggressively and degrade the data rate and latency of Wi-Fi nodes. We show in this paper that an adversary who intends to deny service to Wi-Fi can stealthily exploit this unfairness to drastically reduce the spectrum occupancy and data rate of Wi-Fi nodes. We then propose a novel implicit channel coordination (ICC) approach to mitigate the attack and improve sharing fairness. In ICC, Wi-Fi nodes influence 5G gNB into choosing a precoding matrix that nearly nullifies downlink signals at Wi-Fi nodes.

By masking the confidential signal with the help of the cooperative jammer, the signal-to-noise ratio of the eavesdropper can be selectively reduced without prior information, whereas the authorized receiver is unaffected since the CJ can be suppressed by some means. Unfortunately, with the impacts of the clock jitter caused by non-ideal crystals, the received CJ may suffer sampling clock offset, carrier frequency offset and phase noise, which deteriorates the performance of the CJ cancellation at the authorized receiver. In this paper, the impacts of clock jitter on CJ cancellation are investigated. First, the deterioration of CJ caused by sampling clock offset is modeled as inter-symbol interference (ISI) in the time domain. Then, the impacts of the sampling clock offset, carrier frequency offset and phase noise on the spectral purity of CJ are modeled as inter-frequency interference (IFI). Furthermore, the expression of the power of residual CJ (PRCJ) is derived to analyze the impacts of clock jitter on CJ cancellation. Finally, numerical results prove the theoretical analysis, indicating that the PRCJ increases as the carrier frequency offset and the 3 dB coherence bandwidth of phase noise increases, and is more sensitive to phase noise.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:08","2023-09-19 10:31:08","","4142-4147","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It receives flow rules from the controller and uses them to handle network traffic. However, a flow table can only store a few thousand flow rules, which makes it an attractive target for table overflow attacks. These attacks force the controller to populate the flow table with a large number of meaningless flow rules, which prevents normal flows from finding matching rules and therefore having to be reported to the controller. It results in a significant latency overhead, degrading the performance of the whole network. In this paper, we present a key characteristic of table overflow attacks: even though attackers can change some critical attack parameters (e.g., attack speed) to avoid detection, proactive flows from the attacked port always occupy a stable proportion in the flow table regardless of the attack form. In light of this finding, we propose TableGuard, a novel security mechanism that uses the proactive flow rule number as the detection metric and applies a statistical approach to help filter malicious flows. The experiments demonstrate that TableGuard can mitigate both high-rate and low-rate table overflow attacks. Compared with existing defenses, TableGuard has the best mitigation performance and the minimal overhead on normal flows.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:09","2023-09-19 10:31:09","","4167-4172","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper analyzes the risk of asymmetric DDoS attacks faced by insecure serverless functions. These attacks can occupy a large amount of CPU or memory resources without redundant connections. They can affect the quality of service, delay response time, or even interrupt the service. Autoscaling lacks resilience to such attacks. We test the effects of these attacks in experimental environments and Alibaba Cloud's serverless application engine (SAE). In SAE, we increase the response time from 0.2 seconds to 25 seconds or crash the target function within 6 seconds. Compared with traditional DDoS attacks, asymmetric DDoS attacks are more effective for serverless applications. Finally, we design solutions to mitigate asymmetric DDoS attacks for applications with long and short response times in serverless environments.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:09","2023-09-19 10:31:09","","4179-4184","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such networks, each base station (BS) with an intelligent logic can automatically tilt the direction of its radio antennas based on the trajectory of UAV s. For this purpose, we first formulate AMC as an integer optimization problem for maximizing the minimum transmission rate of UAVs by jointly optimizing the angles of the different radio antenna, the resource allocation and the selection of the appropriate serving BS for the UAVs throughout their path. For this complex optimization problem, we then propose a solution based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve it. Under this solution, we adopt a multi-heterogeneous agent-based approach (MHA-DRL) including two types of agents, namely the UAV agents and the BS agents. Each agent implements an Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) to learn optimal policies. Specifically, the BS agents aim to tilt their antennas to get ahead of the UAV s throughout their mobility, and the UAV agents target selecting the appropriate serving BSs along with resource allocation. Performance evaluations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:26","2023-09-19 10:31:26","","2975-2980","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One common approach to address this problem, called as personalized federated learning (PFL), is to train a personalized model for each client. A key design issue in PFL-based methods is determining which parts of the model should be personalized for each client. For example, one popular method in PFL is to personalize the batch normalization layers. In this paper, we propose ChannelFed, a new PFL-based method which personalizes the channel attention module. ChannelFed is designed based on the following observation: Channel attention assigns different weights to channels for different classes of data, which can be utilized to exploit knowledge of heterogeneous data from different clients. By keeping the channel attention module localized, ChannelFed enables clients to concentrate on client-specific channels. ChannelFed implements normalization across samples in the channel attention module to better fit for statistical heterogeneity scenarios. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that ChannelFed outperforms other PFL methods under statistical heterogeneity scenarios.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:26","2023-09-19 10:31:26","","2987-2992","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a large number of labeled fault data is required for the FL technique, which is not accessible in real-world industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) scenarios. To address the data scarcity challenge (i.e., few-shot), we propose a collaborative learning method that incorporates meta-learning into the federated learning framework. Specifically, our approach learns an effectively global meta-learner, which can quickly adapt to a new machine or a newly encountered fault category with just a few labeled examples and training iterations. Further, we theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm in a non-convex setting.

Functional encryption (FE) is considered as a new approach to address privacy-preserving federated learning probelms, but the only known FE solution has severe security issues such as leaking master private key, and is impractical.

To this end, we propose a task offloading approach based on data and resource heterogeneity under HFEL to improve training performance and reduce system cost. Specifically, we leverage information entropy to incorporate data statistical features into the cost function to reshape edge datasets. In addition, we applied Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) with a resource allocation module to generate distributed offloading policy more efficiently.

In this paper, we propose a highly efficient secure aggregation scheme, Fast-Aggregate, which significantly reduces the communication and computation overhead while ensuring data privacy and robustness against clients' dropout. Firstly, Fast-Aggregate employs a multi-group regular graph for efficient secure aggregation to boost data parallelism. Secondly, we leverage polynomial multi-point evaluation and fast Lagrange interpolation methods to handle clients' dropout as well as reduce computational complexity. Finally, we adopt an additive mask to guarantee clients' privacy. Riding on the capabilities of Fast-Aggregate, we achieve the secure aggregation overhead of O (N log2 $N$), as opposed to O (N2) in the state-of-the-art works.

On the other hand, we optimize power, bandwidth, and learning parameters to avoid communication congestion and enable an energy-efficient transmission between the central server and edge devices.

Fueled by this issue, we consider a clustered FL (CFL) method where the devices are divided into several clusters according to their data distributions and are trained simultaneously. Convergence analysis is conducted, which shows that the clustered model performance depends on cosine similarity, device number per cluster, and device participation probability. Then, aiming at optimizing the model training performance, a joint problem of resource allocation and device clustering is formulated, which is solved by decoupling it into two sub-problems. Specifically, a coalition formation algorithm is proposed for the device clustering sub-problem, and the sub-problem of bandwidth allocation and transmit power control is solved directly due to its convexity. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted on the MNIST dataset to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of test accuracy.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:34","2023-09-19 10:31:34","","3077-3082","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, various techniques have been developed for clickstream mining, which is a specific type of sequential pattern mining, to discover the underlying patterns from the Internet user clickstream. Due to the complexity of clickstream patterns, many of the existing works applied sequential pattern algorithms to generate an exponential candidate space of patterns with respect to patterns letters. Further, those patterns were generated in a noiseless environment. To address this problem, we focus on a nonoverlapping clickstream pattern mining task with noisy interleaving clicks between the clickstream patterns letters. Additionally, we are interested in labeling the extracted patterns in the user browsing history. A modified suffix tree is proposed to extract those patterns with the exact occurrence in the user noisy database. Following this, we model the user browsing behavior via a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the dependencies between the extracted patterns and then predict the future clickstream patterns. Experimental results on both real-life and synthetic datasets show that our proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art benchmarks in efficiency and prediction accuracy.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:34","2023-09-19 10:31:34","","3083-3088","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, if network traffic pattern changes, the learned RL policy cannot adapt accordingly, resulting in system performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-teacher MOdel BAsed Reinforcement Learning algorithm (MOBA), which leverages multi-teacher knowledge distillation theory to learn a generalized load balancing policy for adapting the real-world traffic pattern changes. The key is that different teachers represent different traffic patterns, and can learn various system models. By distilling and transferring the teacher knowledge, the student network is able to learn a generalized system model that covers different traffic patterns and unseen situations. Moreover, to improve the robustness of multi-teacher knowledge transfer, we learn a set of student models and use an ensemble method to jointly predict system dynamics. Results show that, compared with state-of-the-art RL methods, MOBA improves the minimal throughput and total throughput of a cellular network by up to 28.6% and 23.2%.

In this paper, the queue-stable STAR-RIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication system is investigated to ensure the stability of queueing systems. To tackle the challenge of infinite time slots required for stability, the long-term stability-oriented problem is reformulated to maximize the per-slot queue-weighted sum rate (QWSR) of users. In particular, the rate weight allocated for each user is determined by the length of a data queue, which is maintained at the base station (BS) and pending to be delivered to each user. Then, the QWSR is maximized by jointly optimizing the NOMA decoding order, the active beamforming coefficients (ABCs) at the BS, and the passive transmission and reflection coefficients (PTRCs) at the STAR-RIS. To handle the highly-coupled and non-convex problem, the blocked coordinate descent and the successive convex approximation methods are invoked to iteratively and alternatively optimize the problem.

To maximize the achievable rate at the user, we first design the optimal beamforming of the BS and selected (active/passive) IRSs for a given multi-reflection path, and then propose an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal multi-reflection path by using the path decomposition method and graph theory. We show that the active IRS should be selected to establish the beam routing path when its amplification power and/or number of active reflecting elements are sufficiently large.

To handle this problem, interference alignment (IA) schemes attract great attention as they can effectively restrain IUI. However, the existing IA schemes cannot achieve antenna adaptation and the obtained degree of freedom (DoF) may be not optimal. In this paper, a novel antenna adaptation based interference elimination and regeneration (AA-IER) scheme is proposed for cooperative networks, where a relay with hybrid antenna array structure is adopted to assist the communication. The proposed transmission process is completed in two phases, including interference elimination phase (IEP) and interference regeneration phase (IRP). For the former, the IUI is eliminated and the redundant symbols are erased so that the received signal of multiple users can be decoded simultaneously. For the latter, the redundant symbols of all users are regenerated where the space resources are fully utilized. The simulation results show that AA-IER scheme obtains higher DoF than that of three benchmark schemes. Meanwhile, it requires fewer antennas of relay than HAA-CIE-RIA scheme.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:41","2023-09-19 10:31:41","","3180-3185","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All these limit the application of HLBR in reality. In this paper, we propose TWLBR, a real-time detection system for inferring the localization and behavior of human behind brick walls from radar heatmaps.

The network takes four radar heatmaps with background removal as input and outputs the location and behavior of the target humans. Our experiments show that TWLBR can locate and recognize the behavior of target humans behind a 24 cm brick wall with a localization accuracy of 6.2 cm and a behavior recognition accuracy of 96.37%, which is better than existing methods.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:41","2023-09-19 10:31:41","","3186-3191","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The essential component of PAS that breeds this widespread interest is the amplitude shaping block, through which the channel input distribution is controlled. This block is responsible for converting bit strings into amplitude sequences with certain properties, e.g., fixed composition, limited energy, limited energy variation, etc. Recently, band-trellis enumerative sphere shaping (B-ESS) was introduced as an amplitude shaping technique that achieves limited energy variations which is useful in optical communication scenarios. B-ESS operates based on a trellis diagram in which sequences with high energy variations are pruned. In this work, we study the implementation of B-ESS. We first show that thanks to the trellis structure obtained by this pruning, B-ESS can be implemented with very low storage complexity. The trellis computation is shown to be reduced to a set of recursive multiplications with a scalar factor. Then we show that this scalar factor can be adjusted such that the trellis computation is further simplified and realized with only binary shifts. This shift-based B-ESS (1) can be implemented for arbitrarily long blocklengths without incurring an increase in complexity, and (2) can operate in a streaming mode similar to convolutional coding.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:43","2023-09-19 10:31:43","","3223-3228","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, higher iterations will lead to the higher computational complexity of the MPA. In this paper, a dynamic threshold and stability judgment based MPA scheme (DTS-MPA) is proposed to reduce the computational complexity by simplifying the factor graph and reducing the number of iterations. Firstly, an adaptive dynamic threshold is set to minimize the number of iterations in the different channel state information. Secondly, an additional iteration is proposed to determine whether the variable nodes that meet the dynamic threshold reach stable convergence to improve the decoding reliability. Variable nodes that meet the above conditions will be decoded in advance.

By introducing the backoff mechanism, only devices with non-empty buffer and a successful backoff can request access. Unlike previous works on GFRA that regard all devices selecting the same pilot as undetectable, we set a unique collision area for each device to quantify the boundary that BS can detect the collision. With tools of stochastic geometry and queueing theory, we derive a tight approximation for the number of packets successfully transmitted at unit area and time slot, named as packet throughput (Tp). Based on it, we find that the range of the collision area has a remarkable effect on Tp. The optimal backoff parameter that maximizes Tp is also obtained, and we find that a long backoff time is needed when the pilot is insufficient or the packet traffic is heavy. Compared with the fully-loaded access, our optimal backoff mechanism can significantly improve Tp, especially for the system with crowded devices.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:50","2023-09-19 10:31:50","","3320-3325","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, called Balanced Twin Auto-Encoder (BTAE) which consists of three components, i.e., an encoder, a hermaphrodite, and a decoder. The encoder of BTAE first aims to transfer the input data into the latent space before data samples (pre-images) are translated into this space by different translation vectors. In addition, the data of the skewed labels are also generated in the latent space to address the problem of imbalanced data in which the number of attack samples is often significantly lower than those of the benign samples. Second, the hermaphrodite component serves as a bridge to move the data from the encoder to the decoder. Third, the decoder tries to copy the distribution of the samples in the latent space. BTAE is trained by a supervised learning technique, and its data representation extracted from the decoder can well distinguish the attack from the normal data. The experiments on five loT botnet datasets show that BTAE outperforms three existing groups of methods, e.g., the typical supervised learning, the well-known sampling, and the state-of-the-art representation learning. In addition, the false alarm rate (FAR) of BTAE applied for loT intrusion detection is less than equal to 1.2%.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:55","2023-09-19 10:31:55","","3387-3392","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Defensive deception (DD) is an essential strategy against threats by misleading attackers' observations and beliefs. Honeypots are widely used for cyber deception that aims to confuse attackers and waste their resources and efforts. Defenders may use low-interaction honeypots or high-interaction honeypots. In this paper, we consider a hybrid honeypot system that balances the use of the two levels of honeypot complexity, where high-interaction honeypots are more capable of deceiving skilled attackers than low-interaction honeypots. We present a two-player hypergame model that characterizes how a defender should deploy low and high-interaction honeypots to defend the network against malicious reconnaissance activities. We model the tradeoff of each player and characterize their best strategies within a hypergame framework that considers the imperfect knowledge of each player toward their opponent. Finally, our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed honeypot system.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:55","2023-09-19 10:31:55","","3393-3398","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While many attack detection approaches exist, few of them provide easily interpretable and actionable network-level signatures. Further, most tools are either not scalable or are prohibitively expensive, and thus are not broadly available to network operators. We bridge this gap by proposing AMON-SENSS, an open-source system for scalable, accurate DDoS detection and signature generation in large networks. AMON-SENSS employs hash-based binning with multiple bin layers for scalability, observes traffic at multiple granularities, and deploys traffic volume and traffic asymmetry change-point detection techniques to identify attacks. It proactively devises network-level attack signatures, which can be used to filter attack traffic. We evaluate AMON-SENSS against two commercial defense systems, using 37 days of real traffic from a mid-size Internet Service Provider (ISP). We find that our proposed approach exhibits superior performance in terms of accuracy, detection time and network signature quality over commercial alternatives. AMON-SENSS is deployable today, it is free, and requires no hardware or routing changes.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:55","2023-09-19 10:31:55","","3399-3404","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since fast port scans can be effectively detected by many existing methods, some advanced attackers perform slow port scans in order not to be suspected. A highly stealthy slow scan can last for dozens of days, which brings significant challenges to current intrusion detection approaches. Besides, the existing port scan detection methods are all based on full traffic. They are not suitable for high-speed networks because of huge computational and storage resource consumption. According to the protocol characteristics and the connection patterns of port scans, we construct a traffic feature set that can not only distinguish the specific scan types, but also remain effective for the sampled traffic. Furthermore, we customize a data structure Scan Detection Sketch (SDS) for feature extraction. Experimental results using public datasets show that our method can detect slow port scans in a 10Gbps high-speed network with high accuracy and acceptable memory consumption.

A famous example of this attack was launched by Mirai botnet on Dyn DNS architecture in 2016. Researchers have proposed solutions to detect these attacks; however, they predominantly apply static thresholds to the count of NXD responses. This method can result in high false positives and needs to be customized to the traffic pattern of victim DNS servers, making it practically challenging for adoption at the source of potential attacks. This paper aims to detect possibly infected hosts of a university campus network that take part in this specific type of DNS-based attacks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We analyze 120 days' worth of DNS traffic collected from the border of a large university campus network to draw insights into the characteristics of non-existent domain (NXD) responses from incoming DNS packets. We discuss how malicious NXDs differ from benign ones and highlight two attack scenarios based on their requested domain names; (2) We develop a method using multi-staged iForest models to detect malicious internal hosts based on the attributes of their DNS activity; (3) We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed method by applying it to live DNS data streams in our university campus network. We show how our models can detect infected hosts that generate high-volume and low-volume distributed non-existent DNS queries with more than 99% accuracy of correctly classifying legitimate hosts.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:56","2023-09-19 10:31:56","","3411-3416","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Telecom operators provide “slices” of their networks to different industries (e.g., automotive, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and eHealth), targeting to increase the resource utilization and Return on Investment (ROI). However, as the service demand increases, slice management becomes particularly complex, especially in the Radio Access Network (RAN) section, since virtualized infrastructures are significantly more complex to manage compared to physical networks. In this paper, a novel 5G New Radio (5G NR) NS management framework is presented, which targets to define the optimal NS parameterization for the entire Fronthaul (FH) 5G network. Our solution is divided into three phases: i) definition of the 5G Downlink Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (DL-HARQ) parameters (K0, K1), ii) the dynamic (inter-slice) partitioning of the radio resources among the slices, inline with the Service Level Agreement (SLA), and, iii) an intra-slice scheduling algorithm for the user prioritization, given real-time user's traffic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) analysis.

Efficient and dynamic orchestration of slices is needed to ensure the stringent and diverse service level agreements (SLAs) required by different services. In this paper, we provide a model that attempts to capture the problem of dynamic slice embedding and reconfiguration supporting a multi-domain setup and diverse, end-to-end SLAs. We then show that such problems can be optimally solved, in theory, with (tabular) Reinforcement Learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning) even under, a priori, unknown demand dynamics for each slice. Nevertheless, the state and action complexity of such algorithms is prohibitive, even for very small scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel scheme based on independent DQN agents: The DQN component implements approximate Q-learning, based on simple, generic DNNs for value function approximation, radically reducing state space complexity; the independent agents then tackle the equally important issue of exploding action complexity arising from the combinatorial nature of embedding multiple VNFs per slice, multiple slices, over multiple domains and computing nodes therein. Using realistic data, we show that the proposed algorithm reduces convergence time by orders of magnitude with minimum penalty of decision optimality.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:31:58","2023-09-19 10:31:58","","3429-3434","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Network slicing is an innate feature of the Fifth Generation (5G) and Beyond-5G (B5G) networks, bringing many advantages but also increasing the complexity of managing such networks. In this context, automation tools based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become a preeminent instrument of automation used by the industry, as it would be impossible to manually provision and manage such a vast and dynamic infrastructure. Safe interaction of the AI agents with the network is one of the predominant challenges, especially when Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used in critical environments. This is particularly important when the RL agent actions have a high or irreversible impact on the network or service. Slice management is one of the major features that operators want to automate, to offer future services at large scales with manageable complexity to the operator. However, during the exploration phase, RL agents can cause significant performance degradation during operation and possibly introduce irreversible damage to the service being offered. To address this major challenge, we propose a multi-agent, modular, SafeRL architecture for distributed slice orchestration.

We first formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal sub-band bandwidth and transmit power, and then propose the unsupervised learning-based approach to obtaining the near-optimal solution to this problem.

Simulation results for regular LDPC codes confirm that the check node aware design, especially for very coarse quantization with 2- or 3-bit messages, achieves performance gains of up to 0.2 dB - without additional hardware costs. We also show that the 2-bit message resolution enables a very efficient implementation of the check node update, which requires only 2/9 of the 3-bit check node's transistor count and reduces the signal propagation delay by a factor of 4.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:04","2023-09-19 10:32:04","","3484-3489","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our proposed decoder operates similarly to a layered min-sum decoder with additional reconstruction and quantization operations by using single-input lookup tables (LUTs). In particular, we first develop the protograph-based MIM density evolution to design the LUTs, which may differ for each iteration and each edge in the protograph of the QC-LDPC codes. Furthermore, to minimize the memory requirement for storing the LUTs, we propose an optimization method to unify all LUTs into only four distinct LUTs, which can be used for all decoding iterations. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed MIM-QLMS decoders are the first class of layered finite alphabet iterative decoders (FAIDs) that are designed based on accurately tracking the probability distributions of the exchanged messages. Simulation results show that for 3-bit (resp. 4-bit) exchanged message precision, the proposed MIM-QLMS decoders can reasonably (resp. generally) outperform the state-of-the-art layered FAIDs and the layered normalized min-sum decoder, in terms of both the error rate performance and the average number of iterations.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:04","2023-09-19 10:32:04","","3490-3495","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our analysis shows that the loss of preserved mutual information resulting from restriction to uniform quantization is very small. Furthermore, the error rate simulations with regular LDPC codes confirm that the uniform quantization causes only minor performance degradation within 0.01 dB compared to the non-uniform alternative.

Low/medium-interaction honeypot is regarded as a promising lightweight defense to actively protect mobile Internet of things, especially UAV networks. Existing works primarily focused on honeypot design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive issue for motivating UAVs' participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks is still under-explored. This paper proposes a novel game-based collaborative defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive mechanism design, in the pres-ence of network dynamics and UAVs' multi-dimensional private information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs under both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. We then devise a contract-theoretic method to solve the optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial information asymmetry, while ensuring truthfulness, fair-ness, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a reinforcement learning based distributed method to dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the fast-changing network. Experimental simulations show that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV's collaboration in VDD sharing and enhance defensive effectiveness, compared with existing solutions.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:07","2023-09-19 10:32:07","","3521-3526","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main effect of the rapid growth of satellite networks is a broader range of data exchange and business interaction between the internal and external systems, making the network boundaries blur or even disappear. As a result, traditional passive security mechanisms based on dividing network boundaries cannot provide sufficient protection. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a zero-trust and edge intelligence (ZTEI) empowered continuous authentication for satellite networks. We build an improved zero-trust architecture (ZTA) for satellite networks, which expands the traditional zero-trust concept to the multi-dimensional zero-trust that focuses on subject, object, environment, behavior, and physical entity. Then we propose a continuous authentication scheme in the proposed zero-trust architecture, enabling proactive and continuous authentication by periodically monitoring and re-evaluating variable attributes throughout the request lifecycle. Besides, in this scheme, we also design a Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs) based edge intelligence algorithm to improve the authentication accuracy. Finally, we build a testbed to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture. Compared with the attribute-based access control (ABAC) under the traditional zero-trust architecture, our proposed architecture can improve the authentication accuracy of dynamic illegal requests by about 27%. In addition, according to standard network performance evaluation criteria, the loss of processing performance caused by our solution is also within an acceptable range.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:33","2023-09-19 10:32:33","","2376-2381","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current FL approach uses only satellite-to-ground-station links, causing long delay for model parameter transfer. A promising direction to reduce delay is to use inter-satellite links. We identify that ground-assisted asynchronous FL requires a satellite to send all data of its model parameter to ground before ground station can start to update the model. This new feature prevents current routing algorithms (e.g., CGR) from being applicable. Therefore, we propose an FL task-aware routing and resource reservation (FLRRS) scheme to optimize the delay of FL model parameter transfer. First, we formulate the problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, which is non-convex and intractable. Thus, we enhance the storage time-aggregated graph to model computing, storage and transmission resources of satellite network, and propose a graph-based routing and resource reservation algorithm. The numerical simulation based on a real-world satellite network shows that FLRRS runs much faster than CVXPY solver. Besides, FLRRS also significantly improves average delay and number of completed tasks, as compared to current routing algorithms.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:33","2023-09-19 10:32:33","","2382-2387","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By this means, the computational complexity of COP is made independent to the size of multi-antenna (i.e., MIMO) networks. Instead, it is related to the size of symbol constellation. Through widely linear transform, it is shown that COP has its complexity flexibly scalable in the constellation domain to achieve a good complexity-performance tradeoff. Our computer simulations show that COP can offer very comparable performance with the optimum VP in small MIMO systems.

With the increase in array aperture, this evolution leads to the near-field propagation becoming dominant. To achieve the performance gain of XL-RIS, it is effective to explore the near-field beam design with a codebook via beam training. Unfortunately, due to the constant modulus constraint of XL-RIS, most of the existing works in the near-field scenario focus on single-beam design. Hence, these works will face a serious loss for the quality of service in the multiple user equipments case. In this paper, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) based scheme with majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for the multi-beam design. The proposed scheme handles the constant modulus constraint from two aspects. Firstly, the multi-beam design is an intractable non-convex quadratic programming problem due to this constraint. We utilize the MM algorithm to decompose this problem as a series of tractable sub-problems to be iteratively solved. Secondly, the solution space for the multi-beam design is limited due to this constraint, we introduce the phases for beam gains as an extra optimizable variable to enrich the degree of freedom for optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-beam design can achieve a superior quality of service 50% higher than the existing schemes.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:35","2023-09-19 10:32:35","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we consider hard delay constrained transmissions over frequency selective wireless channels or parallel fading channels, in which the instantaneous transmission power can be adapted. A time domain power allocation scheme, also referred to as the generalized channel inversion policy is proposed. We find that the hard delay constraint can be met when the number of parallel channels with independent channel gains is greater than or equal to two. Furthermore, given a target rate, the required average power can be obtained based on the explicit outage probability as a function of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To provide further insight, we present two approximate formulas of the average power based on our derived closed-form approximations for the outage probability in the high SNR regime, and also derive upper and lower bounds on the required average power.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:39","2023-09-19 10:32:39","","2480-2485","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we investigate a bistatic BSC setup with multiple antennas. We propose a novel algorithm to suppress direct link interference between the carrier emitter (CE) and the reader using beamforming into the nullspace of the CE-reader direct link to decrease the dynamic range of the system and increase the detection performance of the backscatter device (BSD). Further, we derive a Neyman-Pearson (NP) test and an exact closed-form expression for its performance in the detection of the BSD. Finally, simulation results show that the dynamic range of the system is significantly decreased and the detection performance of the BSD is increased by the proposed algorithm compared to a system not using beamforming in the CE, which could then be used in a host of different practical fields such as agriculture, transportation, factories, hospitals, smart cities, and smart homes.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:39","2023-09-19 10:32:39","","2486-2492","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, for the proliferation of services, the massive connection between MDs and edge servers (ES) results in huge energy consumption, leading to sustainability issues for greenhouse gas emissions. Besides, quality levels within the same service (e.g., accuracy of object detection, and clarity of video) become subdivided, requiring tighter service environment constraint of ESs for such subdivided quality levels. In this paper, we investigate efficiency-oriented task offloading for services with subdivided quality levels within quality level constraint of ESs. Specifically, we first devise a unified quality-aware service model to abstract out service structure, i.e., the quality-relation, number, and dependency of tasks within it. Then, the offloading algorithm is proposed based on an optimized version of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), in which due to the heterogeneity of services, we also embed a scheduling algorithm for services in advance to improve tasks parallelism for concurrent execution and NSGA-II adaptation. Additionally, compared with other algorithms, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm not only significantly improves the convergence, but also optimizes its energy and latency efficiencies.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:42","2023-09-19 10:32:42","","2548-2553","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It becomes a challenging task to allocate uploading bandwidth allocation for the offloaded tasks from end-user devices under different signal coverage areas. We formulate the optimization problem of bandwidth allocation for the offloaded tasks in the edge server and the offloading decisions as a quadratically constrained quadratic problem. We exploit a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method to solve the problem. Moreover, during optimization, we minimize the adverse impact of bandwidth allocation for poor end-users on good end-users performance.

It adopts a distributed ledger based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure called the Tangle, achieving high concurrency, incremental scalability, and zero transaction fees. While the DAG-based ledger structure can promise many benefits for IOTA, it also exposes a wide attacking surface for the double-spending attack. By creating fake branches to replace the legitimate ones in the Tangle, the attackers can achieve the purpose of double-spending. Therefore, there is a great need for securing IOTA with preventive strategies. In this work, we present the design of an effective preventive strategy for IOTA that can reduce the Tangle vulnerability against the double-spending attack. Our main idea is to in-vestigate the Tangle vulnerability problem by using the large deviation theory. We provide the Tangle vulnerability probability and the decay speed of the probability. By evaluating the decay speed, we find the key factor related to the robustness level against double-spending attacks. Besides, we define and deduce the security threshold based on the evaluation results that can affect the probability decay speed of the Tangle vulnerability. With the security threshold, IOTA can efficiently inspect illegal Tangle branches to resist double-spending attacks. Finally, the comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy is efficient and practical.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:43","2023-09-19 10:32:43","","2572-2578","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And then, leveraging backdoor attacks and eclipse attacks, a novel hybrid vulnerability that can furtively propagate backdoors among swarm learning nodes is identified. To speed up the backdoor propagation and reduce attack costs, a sample-specific eclipse (SSE) strategy that can select the swarm network node with a high data contribution rate as the attack object is also proposed.

In response to this problem, researchers have introduced blockchain to realize decentralized e-voting, but the adoption of blockchain also brings new issues in terms of flexibility, anonymity, and usability. To this end, in this paper, we propose WeVoting, which provides weight-based flexibility with solid anonymity and enhances usability by designing a voter-independent on-chain counting mechanism.

Besides, WeVoting develops a counter-based counting mechanism to enhance usability compared with those self-tallying schemes. By critically designing an honesty-and-activity-based incentive algorithm, WeVoting can guarantee a correct counting result even in the presence of malicious counters.

However, existing data insertion methods are not satisfactory in terms of efficiency, concealment, and scalability. Besides, to save the on-chain cost of inserting data, existing time-stamping services generate a Merkle tree to aggregate files and then utilize Merkle paths to verify the existence of files. However, as the number of files increases, the Merkle path grows in size, leading to a significant communication overhead for the file existence proof. To solve the above problems, we design a novel blockchain-based time-stamping scheme. First, we design a commitment signature scheme to embed data in the addresses and signatures of blockchain transactions, which can insert our data into public blockchains in an efficient, concealed, and scalable fashion without modifying the data structures and signature verifying schemes of the current public blockchains. Second, instead of using a Merkle tree to aggregate files, we utilize a bilinear pairing accumulator to achieve a constant communication overhead for the file existence proof.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect malicious BDNs. First, we extract 16 statistical features of domain names. Second, we construct a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) of BDNS, which can use malicious traditional domain names as supplementary data. Then we associate domain names by meta-paths in the HIN and build an association graph of domain names. To better characterize domain names, we use the graph convolutional network algorithm to fuse the statistical features of domain names in the association graph. Finally, we detect malicious BDNs by the neural network algorithm. Compared with the existing methods, the experimental results show that our method can accurately detect malicious BDNs with the F1 score of 0.9901 and discover more unknown malicious BDNs from the dataset.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:44","2023-09-19 10:32:44","","2597-2602","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a basic and essential security mechanism to detect malicious traffic. In the literature, in addition to traditional machine learning algorithms, many deep learning schemes have been examined to enhance the detection performance. However, insufficient amounts of labeled samples are still a challenge for real-world implementation, especially in some scenarios such as smart home and Internet of Vehicles. To address this issue, we explore transfer learning as a promising solution. In this work, we develop TDL-IDS, a transfer deep learning based IDS that can work with limited labeled data items. Our approach first uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to train a model on the source domain and then leverages transfer learning to continue the training process on the target domain. In the evaluation, we use NSL-KDD as the source domain, and AWID as the target domain. Our results indicate that TDL-IDS can outperform many similar approaches.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:45","2023-09-19 10:32:45","","2603-2608","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The quick development of neural networks has made it one of the main approaches for the implementation of NIDS. However, nowadays more sophisticated attacks have appeared and the analysis of a single traffic cannot ensure the detection of the attack. To make full use of the network traffic data, we proposed a flow-based NIDS using Graph Neural Network (GNN) to explore the structural information of the network and the correlation between traffics. We represented the traffic data in graph structure to capture the topological information and aggregated the general behavior of each node. Moreover, we introduced a discriminator to correct the data imbalance and to improve the flow representations. We evaluated our proposed model on three benchmark datasets. The experiment results showed that our model had improvements of performance in both binary classification tasks and multi-class classification tasks, which demonstrates the value of graph structure in the detection of some attacks.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:45","2023-09-19 10:32:45","","2621-2626","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the key areas for the development of the mmWave networks is the Internet of Things (IoT) communications within fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G networks. For significant analysis and development of the compliant IoT systems through testbed implementation, current mmWave spectrum transceivers are too expensive when substantial number of the nodes is required by the IoT applications. Considering all the above, it is suggested to use Software Defined Radio (SDR) transceivers with a lower frequency band and with an increased distance between the nodes. The idea is to scale observation time and distance to emulate mmWave radio without actual mmWave hardware. Using scaling factors for the certain system parameters to keep the signal characteristics in accordance with the mmWave band makes it possible. This approach allows to develop mmWave IoT testbeds with significant improvement in the system scalability and cost-effectiveness without the need to transmit and receive the signal in the mmWave band. In this paper, the concept of SDR-based Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system combined with the observation time and distance scaling approach is proposed.

Prior studies on delay jitter modeling have proposed using a single probability distribution (e.g., Gamma and Laplace distributions). However, mobility-induced wireless quality fluctuations form a mixture of probability patterns, e.g., several peaks and a heavy tail. This paper proposes a method to estimate delay jitter accurately in high-frequency and mobile communications. Our method has two features. The first is to model the delay jitter by a mixture of multiple Laplace distributions by taking into account the probability patterns. For quick convergence of model training, the model is trained with access manner-aware initialization in each Wi-Fi and mobile network. The second is to construct a likelihood-based observation segmentation for estimating model parameters accurately against mobility. Performance evaluation through experiments in indoor Wi-Fi and outdoor 5G scenarios shows that our proposed method improves modeling accuracy by 28.7% compared with the case of the prior studies.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:46","2023-09-19 10:32:46","","2638-2643","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rather than using a chain structure as in traditional blockchains, IOTA organizes ledger records with a directed acyclic graph (DAG), called Tangle. When message entries are committed into the ledger, the ledger tangle grows in a special way where multiple messages could be attached by different processing nodes in parallel. Such a unique evolution process motivates us to study the ledger tangle dynamics, which is unexplored so far. In this paper, we present the first generative modeling for IOTA tangle based on stochastic analysis. A key finding is that IOTA tangle renders a double Pareto Lognormal (dPLN) distribution, rather not typical network models (e.g., Power-Law and Exponential distributions). Quantitative comparisons show that the fitting quality of our model outperforms existing popular models on official real world datasets published by IOTA Foundation. Estimated model parameters are provided, which is immediately instrumental for a more realistic IOTA network generator design.

The objective is to study the trade-off between complexity (number of antennas) and link performance considering explicit ground reflections. The antennas are assumed to be located at regularly distributed positions across the surface of contiguous vehicles. Under the assumption of symbol repetition across Tx antennas, we also focus on well-known mechanisms such as maximum-ratio and equal-gain combining (MRC and EGC, respectively). The objective is to minimize the outage probability of the V2V link with deterministic and stochastic channel components (i.e., Rice-distributed), where the line-of-sight (LOS) is affected by ground reflections (as an extension of the two-ray model). This scenario is more realistic for V2V applications due to the proximity of the antennas to the ground. The outage probability is averaged over a range of inter-vehicle distances with respect to the free-space loss solution. The results show that performance is improved even for a relatively small number of antennas, and that a point is reached beyond which improvement becomes differential. This suggests an optimum trade-off between outage probability and complexity can be reached over a range of inter-vehicle distances.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:48","2023-09-19 10:32:48","","2656-2661","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, contrary to state of the art, which lacks explainability of data, the framework of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (NeSy AI) is proposed as a pillar for learning causal structure behind the observed data. In particular, the emerging concept of generative flow networks (GFlowNet) is leveraged for the first time in a wireless system to learn the probabilistic structure which generates the data. Further, a novel optimization problem for learning the optimal encoding and decoding functions is rigorously formulated with the intent of achieving higher semantic reliability. Novel analytical formulations are developed to define key metrics for semantic message transmission, including semantic distortion, semantic similarity, and semantic reliability. These semantic measure functions rely on the proposed definition of semantic content of the knowledge base and this information measure is reflective of the nodes' reasoning capabilities. Simulation results validate the ability to communicate efficiently (with less bits but same semantics) and significantly better compared to a conventional system which does not exploit the reasoning capabilities.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:50","2023-09-19 10:32:50","","2698-2703","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with conventional communication systems, semantic communication systems are not only affected by physical noise existing in the wireless communication environment, e.g., additional white Gaussian noise, but also by semantic noise due to the source and the nature of deep learning-based systems. In this paper, we elaborate on the mechanism of semantic noise. In particular, we categorize semantic noise into two categories: literal semantic noise and adversarial semantic noise. The former is caused by written errors or expression ambiguity, while the latter is caused by perturbations or attacks added to the embedding layer via the semantic channel. To prevent semantic noise from influencing semantic communication systems, we present a robust deep learning enabled semantic communication system (R-DeepSC) that leverages a calibrated self-attention mechanism and adversarial training to tackle semantic noise. Compared with baseline models that only consider physical noise for text transmission, the proposed R-DeepSC achieves remarkable performance in dealing with semantic noise under different signal-to-noise ratios.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:50","2023-09-19 10:32:50","","2704-2709","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We validate our proposed backdoor attack to a typical job scheduling task in cloud computing. Numerous experimental results show that our backdoor can achieve excellent effectiveness, stealthiness, and sustainability.

However, due to the heterogeneity of system architecture and variable invocations between services, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the root causes of performance degradation in time. This paper proposes WinG, a system to pinpoint root causes. Firstly, since the characteristic of a system element is difficult to capture due to variable invocations between elements, WinG characterizes an element's status by a feature vector that includes all its invocation relationships. Secondly, WinG adopts a warping procedure to assess an element's anomaly severity based on its status deviation, to mitigate the interference of variable invocations. Thirdly, WinG groups heterogeneous elements with similar invocation characteristics to avoid the interference of diverse elements types. Finally, false alarms are filtered by the anomaly duration and frequency. Experimental evaluation results on the public dataset show that, with the above four methods, WinG can locate root causes with 87% precision, outperforming baseline methods. On average of 78 test cases, it achieves 34% precision improvement over the champion method of the competition.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:51","2023-09-19 10:32:51","","2722-2727","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The trust model is an interesting approach to detect and remove these compromised nodes from the trusted routing table and maintain trust relationships in distributed networks. However, how to construct the secure dominating node to aggregate and forward the information is an enormous challenge in distributed networks. In this paper, a distributed construction algorithm of multi-layer connected dominating set is proposed for secure routing with trust models. The probabilities of nodes being compromised, combined with the trust value of the trust model, are used to construct a trusted multi-layer connected dominating set. Moreover, the impact of a node being compromised on the distributed network is quantified as loss expectation.

In order to provide an immersive experience, the rendered virtual representation in the form of high-quality video needs to be delivered with low latency. The quality of delivered contents is associated with rendering resources and content bitrate, and high-quality contents result in large rendering and transmission delay. The joint resource allocation problem has been formulated, allocating limited bandwidth and edge computing resources, and determining the bitrate of content to achieve low latency and high content quality, in which two objectives are conflicting. To solve this problem, we employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based multi-objective optimization approach which decomposes the original problem into a series of subproblems. Instead of training the DRL model for each subproblem with equal number of episodes, an adaptive subproblem model training scheme has been proposed which terminates the training of subproblem model early based on the model convergence to improve the overall training efficiency.

It enables vehicles to increase their awareness of the environment by sharing their local perception information with others using Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, thus, avoiding potential accidents. This paper studies the sensor errors and properties and reflects their impact on redundant information shared over communication while arguing for the cases where redundant information could be accepted. Specifically, three perspectives are evaluated: perception issues due to object detection errors, localization errors due to inaccuracy in the onboard navigation system (NS) and the effect of different perception Field of View (FoV). The system is implemented and evaluated using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) traffic simulator and a centralized basestation that coordinates the CV2X communication. Results confirm that 63% of the missed vehicles due to detection error can be retrieved using the suggested Estimated Error Detection (EED) approach. The drawback is increasing the number of duplicate information sent to the receiver. While this exhausts the communication resources, it is still useful for cases where detection is hindered (e.g., by weather conditions). Moreover, our experiments show that the system becomes less reliable when the positioning error is above 1 meter. Lastly, we analyze the effect of the Field of View (FoV) on the centralized basestation objective value, highlighting the importance of 360° perception although it increases duplicate information (51%), pointing to further research required for mitigating duplicate information.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:53","2023-09-19 10:32:53","","2739-2744","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we focus on a new analytic approach with low-complexity techniques reducing the peak of the IFFT signal. Among all the cases of modulations, there are a large number of cases called worst peak cases where the energy of the IFFT signal is concentrated on a few samples and producing a peak amplitude corresponding to high PAPR.

To overcome this problem, we propose an intelligent client selection approach for federated learning on IoT devices using matching game theory. Our solution involves the design of: (1) preference functions for the client IoT devices and federated servers to allow them to rank each other according to several criteria such as accuracy and price, and (2) intelligent matching algorithms that take into account the preferences of both parties in their design.

We study the problem under the Neyman-Pearson (NP) setup. We find that, due to the Sybil attack, the decisions received at the FC become correlated and that the degree of correlation is dependent on the number of fake identities used. The paper characterizes the optimal Sybil attack that blinds the FC, i.e., makes the FC incapable of making an informed decision. We find that if the sum of the local detection and false alarm probabilities of the sensor nodes is 1, the FC can be made blind when at least 50% of the decisions are sent using fake identities. However, if this condition is not met, then all decisions would have to be sent using fake identities in order to blind the FC. The paper also investigates strategic interactions between the FC and the Sybil attacker using Game Theory and proves the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE). Numerical results are presented to gain important insights.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:55","2023-09-19 10:32:55","","2770-2775","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IoT devices usually have low computational capabilities making it difficult to implement advanced security features to combat cyber attacks, especially Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which has shown to be a serious threat to edge/cloud networks. Hence, the idea of a network-based MTD consisting of strategic movement of IoT network parameters such as IP addresses and port numbers to avoid a static configuration is very appealing as a way to make it difficult for an attacker to infiltrate the network and compromise devices following prolonged reconnaissance. However, designing effective MTD strategies is challenging, especially when maintaining IoT service performance is key. This paper addresses the following question: When is the right time to trigger MTD adaptations in a resource-constrained IoT network vulnerable to DoS attacks? To answer this question, the paper formulates an optimization problem in an MTD-driven IoT system using a game-theoretic model. The problem is then solved to produce the optimal defense strategies against DDoS attacks, allowing the system to make dynamic MTD decisions over time following the analysis of Nash equilibrium points in terms of various network configurations.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:57","2023-09-19 10:32:57","","2782-2787","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, new research challenges related to B5G networks have emerged, such as resources management and orchestration, service chaining, security, and QoS management. However, there is a lack of a realistic platform enabling researchers to design and validate their solutions effectively, since B5G networks are still in their early stages. In this paper, we first discuss the different methods for deploying realistic B5G platforms for the V2X vertical, including the key B5G technologies. Then, we describe DRIVE-B5G, a novel platform that serves as an end-to-end test-bed to emulate a vehicular network environment, allowing researchers to provide proof of concept, validate, and evaluate their research approaches.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:58","2023-09-19 10:32:58","","2800-2805","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose WiSen, a novel passive human tracking system using one pair of commodity WiFi devices with unknown locations. First, we introduce a signal power model for human-related signal extraction and multi-dimensional parameter estimation. Due to low-resolution parameter estimates and noise, we further design a confidence-aware-based path pruning method that combines the distribution of path parameters from successive windows to select reliable paths of interest. Before that, we adopt a data augmentation method to increase the number of available paths to learn parameter distributions better. Then, we statistically estimate the transmitter's location using a kernel density estimation method and ultimately yield the user's location using an improved Gaussian Sum filter approach. We validate the performance of WiSen in real-life indoor environments. The experimental results show that WiSen can realize the sub-meter level accuracy for passive human tracking and device localization.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:32:59","2023-09-19 10:32:59","","2812-2817","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged in response to such needs of modern networks. SDN lacks adequate security features and Intrusion Detection and Protection Systems (IDPS) have been used to protect SDN from attacks. However, they have limited knowledge of zero day attacks. Machine Learning (ML) has become a valuable tool against these limitations and improve (SDN) network security. However, the solutions that solely rely on ML can struggle to discriminate benign traffic from malicious, and suffer from false negatives. To solve these problems and improve security of SDN-based enterprise networks, we propose S-Pot, an open-source smart honeypot framework. S-Pot uses enterprise and IoT honeypots to attract attackers, learns from attacks via ML classifiers, and dynamically configures the rules of SDN. Since honeypots generally receive only malicious traffic, S-Pot can learn from the received malicious traffic and minimize the false positives of an SDN network. In addition, S-Pot can detect the new attacks using ML classifiers, thus can help to minimize the false negatives. Our performance evaluation of S-Pot in detecting attacks using various ML classifiers show that it can detect attacks with 97% accuracy using J48 algorithm. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of S-Pot in improving the security of an enterprise SDN testbed network. Our results demonstrate that, compared to the without S-Pot case, S-Pot can improve the security of the SDN networks by detecting attacks with better performance, greater accuracy, effectively generating rules, and dynamically configuring the network.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:00","2023-09-19 10:33:00","","2818-2824","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the development of the DetN et, hard delay constraints and extremely low loss are highly desired to be guaranteed. However, the bursty data traffic demands and random channel qualities bring uncertainties for transmission, incurring bit dropping due to the possible delay violation. How to support reliable transmission services by reducing bit dropping rates becomes a critical issue in the envisioned sixth-generation (6G) network. To efficiently reduce the bit dropping rate, a joint channel and buffer aware scheduling is highly desired, whose complexity increases exponentially with the number of users. In this paper, we adopt the mean-field approximation to simplify the design and analysis of the joint channel and buffer aware scheduling under a huge number of users.

However, computational complexity, signaling overhead and idle mode mobility management become the major obstacles to the deployment in practice. Besides, the 5G air interface is still likely to be an essential part of 6G, and hence the backward compatibility must be carefully considered. We propose an innovative double layers flexible radio access network architecture, which can provide both multiple transmission points jointly processing gains like the user-centric cell solution but with lower complexity and backward compatibility of the 5G air interface. The new architecture decouples the access and service network functions by introducing an access layer and a service layer. The former works like a traditional cellular network and is responsible for network access and idle mode mobility functions, while the latter serves users using a virtual flexible cell dynamically formed by multiple transmission points. Similar users are further grouped into a cluster and served by a flexible cell. By leveraging the similarity of users belonging to the same cluster, a mobility management algorithm based on trajectory prediction is proposed to show the potential of this new architecture.

Specifically, Software Defined Networking (SDN) created an opportunity to avoid congestion once the centralized controller can gather ongoing and historical information from all network switches and flows. However, the data gathered is enormous, and fast-computing algorithms are crucial for decision-making.

In such a system, multiple loT devices continuously monitors physical environment and sends data to a remote destination for status updates through a Network Function Virtualization (NFV)-enabled network. Considering that the Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement can unnecessarily influence the AoI of the updates, we study the VNF placement problem in such a system. The problem is hence formulated as a mathematical optimization problem aiming to minimize the long-term average AoI of all updates received at the destination. To solve this prob-lem, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based VNF placement approach called VNF-AoI, where a learning agent or decision-maker interacts with a system environment and consequently provides an optimal VNF placement policy according to the experience it has learned. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

However, these methods consider every closed-loop independent of each other which degrades the combined closed-loop performance. Also, when many closed loops are needed, these methods are not easily scalable. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques have shown significant promise in many areas in which traditional closed-loop control falls short, typically for complex coordination and conflict management among loops. In this work, we propose a method based on MARL to achieve intent-based management without the requirement of the model of the underlying system. Moreover, when there are conflicting intents, the MARL agents can implicitly incentivize the loops to cooperate, without human interaction, by prioritizing the important KPIs.

However, these platforms were not designed to support 5G services natively. To illustrate, Kubernetes is designed to be agnostic to the services that it orchestrates and cannot dynamically reconfigure the 5G core according to existing network resources, i.e., it provides a partial dynamic orchestration to perform network slicing.

Two crucial problems are remained unsolved in existing studies: 1) how to perceive the environmental change in the perspective of an IDS? 2) how to make the IDS adaptive in different scenarios? In this paper, a self-adaptive scheme is proposed for IDSs in VANETs based on Bayesian game theory and Deep Q-learning Network (DQN). In the scheme, the interactions between an IDS and attackers are formulated as a dynamic intrusion detection game, in which the proposed scheme decides either to just adjust or to completely retrain the IDS. The Nash Equilibria (NE) of the game is derived to reveal how the optimal decision of the IDS depends on the detection performance and road conditions.

It is primarily done to meet the latency requirements of tasks, and QoS requirements of the network. In addition to providing localized computing and storage services, the fog network also needs to support end-device mobility while handling offloaded tasks, especially, to mimic the ubiquitous availability of the cloud. Most of the existing works in this direction either recommend task migration or offloading tasks by predicting the device's location. Both these approaches are shown to have their respective limitations, and, thus a mobility-aware task offloading scheme is crucial to meet end-device task requirements. In this paper, we present an approach to handle the mobility of end-devices for effectively handling offloaded tasks. The proposed mechanism is simple, effective, and is not constrained by a device's location, thereby lowering the costs associated with mobility. Especially, the proposed scheme entirely eliminates the cost induced during migration, since effective task offloading can lessen the necessity to attempt task migrations.

Despite its benefit, it is a challenge for blockchain to effectively operate in large-scale networks without compromising security and decentralization properties due to low throughput. Therefore, in this paper, we consider sharding-based blockchain as a solution to overcome this limitation. The objective is to split the network into different shards to process transactions in parallel and reduce quorum size to reach consensus quickly. However, existing sharding-based blockchain networks implement a consensus algorithm for both main and sub-shards, so it is ineffective with different purposes (e.g., to improve security, reduce resource consumption, etc.). Hence, we propose a system with heterogeneous consensus algorithms in sharding-based blockchain to meet different requirements. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves up to 54 percent of throughout in comparison with benchmarks.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:06","2023-09-19 10:33:06","","2903-2908","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The deployment of DRL policies in real networks, however, is complicated by heterogeneous cell conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning (TL) aided multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach with inter-agent similarity analysis for inter-cell inter-slice resource partitioning. First, we design a coordinated MADRL method with information sharing to intelligently partition resource to slices and manage inter-cell interference. Second, we propose an integrated TL method to transfer the learned DRL policies among different local agents for accelerating the policy deployment. The method is composed of a new domain and task similarity measurement approach and a new knowledge transfer approach, which resolves the problem of from whom to transfer and how to transfer. We evaluated the proposed solution with extensive simulations in a system-level simulator and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of performance, convergence speed and sample efficiency. Moreover, by applying TL, we achieve an additional gain over 27% higher than the coordinated MADRL approach without TL.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:07","2023-09-19 10:33:07","","2909-2914","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These healthcare parameters usually contain sensitive information, such as heart rates, glucose levels and etc., and the exposure of them may pose serious threats to the patients' health and lives. To guarantee security and privacy, many IoMT data sharing schemes have been proposed. However, most of these schemes either exhibit a one-to-one data sharing structure or fail to protect the patients' privacy. Since the data usually needs to be shared to different physicians, patients may want to be assisted without revealing their identities. To meet these requirements in healthcare systems, we propose a multi-receiver secure healthcare data sharing scheme, in which the patients are allowed to share their IoMT data to multiple physicians simultaneously for a multidisciplinary treatment, and the conditional anonymity is achieved where data source authentication is provided without revealing the patient's identity. When the patient health condition is abnormal, the hospital can correctly and quickly trace the patient's identity and inform him/her immediately. Our scheme is formally proved to achieve multiple security properties including confidentiality, unforgeability and anonymity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is efficient and practical.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:07","2023-09-19 10:33:07","","2915-2920","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the C+L band, which band should be upgraded first in the next stage is an open question. In this paper, we try to answer this by comparing the potential capacity increase and the investment cost to upgrade different bands. We propose an OSNR estimation model comprehensively covering various impairments to evaluate the quality of transmission of an optical channel. Along with routing and spectrum assignment, a traffic grooming algorithm is also developed to evaluate the capacity that can be achieved after upgrading different bands in an optical network. Our studies show that the E band should be the first to be upgraded next since it both expands the transmission capacity significantly using only a few additional amplifiers, and also improves the quality of transmission of the C+L band.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:09","2023-09-19 10:33:09","","2933-2938","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, hybrid amplifiers are costlier than the widely deployed EDF amplifiers (EDFAs). Therefore, it is critical to place them only at selected fiber spans of the network such that their number is also kept to a minimum. Hybrid amplifier placement is a complex task in mesh networks due to the diverse optical channels (i.e., with different source and destination nodes) traversing each fiber span. This paper proposes an optimal method to solve the problem of placing hybrid amplifiers in mesh networks. It builds on the approximation that noise adds up incoherently along the transmission path to derive an integer linear programming (ILP) model that determines the minimum number and location of hybrid EDF/Raman amplifiers required to reach a target set of feasible optical channels (i.e., without intermediate 3R regenerators). A comprehensive set of network simulations using a reference optical network provides evidence that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:09","2023-09-19 10:33:09","","2939-2944","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this perspective, we propose a new modular photonic integrated multi-band wavelength selective switch (WSS) to implement a novel reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM) architecture. The proposed WSS can operate on a broad spectrum range, covering the three S+C+L bands, and is potentially scalable to large numbers of output fibers and routed channels while maintaining a small footprint. We investigated the network performance assessment of the ROADM architecture based on the proposed multi-band WSS on a German network, and a detailed comparison is given for both SDM and BDM solutions.

Hence the cellular network must satisfy the high data rate demand of both the UAV and gUEs. For that, we explore interference mitigation solutions, and propose a novel algorithm for UAV cell-selection which minimizes the impact of the UAV to the concerned serving cell.

Specifically, this paper studies a heterogeneous network (HetNet) assisted by a movable RABS as a small cell which connects to a macro base station (MBS) through a limited-capacity wireless backhaul link, which can be deemed as another major challenge. To exploit the potential gains that the mobility of RABS can bring in the system, the minimum rate among all users is maximized by jointly optimizing the RABS deployment, user association and subcarrier allocation. This problem is initially formulated as a binary polynomial optimization (BPO) problem. After reformulating it as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), we propose a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based heuristic method to capture a high-quality solution in polynomial time. Numerical results reveal that deploying a RABS as the small cell can improve the minimum data rate by 95.43% at most and 33.97% on average, and the developed SDR heuristic algorithm significantly outperforms the linear relaxation (LR) baseline method.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:10","2023-09-19 10:33:10","","2963-2968","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So it is essential to ensure the reliability of the message before acting on considering that.

Our objective is to keep the signature size constant regardless of the threshold value.

We then develop a theoretical framework to consider the selfish agent, and study various adversarial scenarios (including attacks with disruptive goals) via simulations. Our robust MARL approach where “robust” agents are trained to be prepared for selfish agents in testing phase achieves more resiliency in the presence of a selfish agent and even a sabotage one; achieving 6.7%~20% and 50.7% ~ 138% higher unicast throughput and broadcast delivery success rate over regular benign agents, respectively.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:52","2023-09-19 10:33:52","","1769-1775","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blockchain is a rapidly emerging technology in this domain. It demonstrated effectiveness thanks to the cryptographic mechanisms it utilizes and to its immutability. Private blockchains are the most suited to applications that require privacy and confidentiality when data is very sensitive. In this case, the most commonly used consensus protocol is Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). However, PBFT requires the participation of all nodes in the consensus process, which increases bandwidth consumption and consensus delay significantly. In this paper, we propose an adaptive PBFT protocol called APBFT that optimizes the number of nodes participating in the consensus based on their response time and credibility. Therefore, we reduce the amount of communication and the response delays. We maintain the asynchrony of the algorithm so that it remains resilient to DoS attacks. The simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms the original PBFT in terms of delays and message traffic.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:52","2023-09-19 10:33:52","","1788-1793","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meeting those requirements over Wi-Fi links is challenging even considering the efficient scheduling techniques provided by the latest Wi-Fi generations (e.g., based on IEEE 802.11ax). In this paper we introduce the concept of Scheduled Transmission Opportunities (S-TXOP) where the network controller exploits the deterministic traffic pattern associated with most time-sensitive applications to minimize the control overhead and provide scheduled channel access that can meet very low latency cycles.

However, these frequencies suffer from high path and penetration losses. One way to improve the performance is network densification which comes with higher operational cost. To reduce the operational cost of Base Station (BS) deployment, the 3GPP has proposed the Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) architecture. Nonetheless, when a handover does occur in IAB networks, even with minimal handover time, the traffic that is already en route to the UE is delayed, as the new serving BS must retrieve the packets from either the previous serving BS or the core. To address these challenges, we propose Fast Wireless Backhaul (FWB), a new wireless backhaul solution. FWB takes advantage of the multi-connectivity of UEs and the high-capacity low-cost wireless backhaul promised by IAB to reduce latency and increase reliability in case of unexpected blockages on the wireless signal path. In FWB, the BSs serving the UE participate in a multicast tree, and receive all packets designated for the UE, but only one BS transmits packets to the UE. In the event of a link failure between the UE and the serving BS, another BS takes over to maintain the data plane connection, without first having to retrieve undelivered downlink packets. We believe our architecture can enable mission critical applications with stringent latency and reliability requirements.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:54","2023-09-19 10:33:54","","1813-1818","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The exponential growth in these networks poses various privacy and security threats for the users and the vendors. Among these threats are Sybil attacks, which occurs due to poor authentication capabilities and thus a malicious node gets access to any information on the host. The malicious node uses its' fake identities to impersonate legitimate nodes and transmit misleading data to the central entity. However, conventional cryptographical approaches are not always suitable for IoT nodes due to the their limited resources. Therefore, physical layer security (PLS) solutions become more and more important for IoT networks. In this regard, this study introduces a novel technique for detecting Sybil attacks in mobile networks, which stands in contrast to the current methods developed for stationary environment, i.e., time-invariant channel. Specifically, this work exploits the Doppler shift caused by the mobility in the environment to identify Sybil nodes in the network. If the nodes belong to the same terminal, they experience the same amount of Doppler shift. The detection performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated under different system configurations. The obtained results show that the performance of the proposed scheme improves as the amount of Doppler shift increases.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:55","2023-09-19 10:33:55","","1838-1843","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With an inference attack, an adversary can collect real-time data from the communication between smart microgrids and a 5G gNodeB to train a surrogate (i.e., shadow) model of the targeted classifier at the edge. To anticipate the associated impact of an adversary's capability to collect real-time data instances, we study five different cases, each representing different amounts of real-time data instances collected by an adversary. Out of six ML models trained on the complete dataset, K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) is selected as the surrogate model, and through simulations, we demonstrate that the multi-stage gray-box attack is able to mislead the ML classifier and cause an Evasion Increase Rate (EIR) up to 73.2% using 40% less data than what a white-box attack needs to achieve a similar EIR.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:55","2023-09-19 10:33:55","","1844-1849","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A rigorous detection assessment using an open-source dataset reveals meaningful performance trends for various attacks. In particular, while the majority of attacks can be effectively detected, detection may be curtailed for certain misbehavior types due to partly inaccurate clustering and erratic activity of the attacker over time.

Existing RF-DFPP methods typically employ received signal strength indicator (RSSI), ignoring the potential benefits of fine-grained sensing accuracy of channel state information (CSI). In addition, the robustness of such sensing methods is not good at present. To solve the problem, in this paper, we propose a robust CSI-based RF-DFPP method using a combination network of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and attention-based bi-directional long short term memory (LSTM). The combined network can extract the signal features of the collected CSI through CNN, and then realize RF-DFPP recognition through the training of LSTM and attention layers.

Transfer learning allows pretrained networks to be reused on large-scale datasets, making it a kind of solution for modulation signal recognition in limited data. The method of suppressing small singular values in the feature vector is employed in this paper to realize selective knowledge transfer for modulation signal recognition, while stochastic normalization is employed to replace the batch normalization layer to avoid over-fitting. We tested the stochastic normalized selective knowledge transfer method on the RML2016.10A and RML2016.04C datasets, with an SNR of 6dB signal samples, and found that it can lead to average growth of 15.77% and 10.32% when compared to direct training, and 6.1% and 2.73% when compared to vanilla fine-tuning.

Furthermore, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) criterion is leveraged to design the cost function for obtaining the maximum posterior probability in the classifier components. Different from the assumption in conventional method, the prior probability of each transmit power levels is unknown to the TPIN, and the array of training set is randomly disturbed. In addition, in order to verify the ability of TPIN in data features extraction, a comparison reference experiment using a general test statistic (e.g., higher-order cumulative) as the observation data is introduced.

In this paper, we are interested in the pilot design and signal detection when the primary transmission adopts orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme. In particular, in order to preserve the channel orthogonality among the OFDM sub-carriers, each secondary symbol is designed to span one OFDM symbol. The comb-type pilot is employed by the primary transmission, while the preamble pilot is used by the secondary transmission. With the designed pilot structures, the primary signal can be detected via the conventional methods by treating the secondary signal as a part of the composite channel. Furthermore, the secondary signal can be extracted from the estimated composite channel with the help of the detected primary signal. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the primary and secondary transmissions with both perfect and estimated CSI is analyzed.

On one hand, a satisfactory QoE accounts for not only the playback quality but also the playback smoothness. On the other hand, the large data volume of a selected tile requires the transmission to be adaptive to the system uncertainties. This paper applies a Markov decision process to formulate the problem of tile selection across the infinite discrete time horizon. In particular, a system state includes the FoV information, which is predicted from the Transformer. To alleviate the dependence on system uncertainty statistics, a deep reinforcement learning approach is derived for solving the optimal control policy. Under different settings, we conduct experiments based on the real throughput and head-mounted display data.

To obtain the appealing potential value of the optimal solution in the context of large-scale live videos, we develop a distributed control framework that can find near-optimal solutions at fine-grained timescales. Evaluations on real-world live video traces show that our distributed controller derives high-quality (in terms of both performance and cost) overlay routing solutions while reducing the decision latency by 38%-89% compared to the state-of-the-art centralized controller.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:58","2023-09-19 10:33:58","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To cope with this issue, this paper leverages Peer-to-Peer (P2P), Content Delivery Network (CDN), edge computing, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and distributed video transcoding paradigms to introduce a hybRId P2P-DN arcHfiTecture for livE video stReaming (RICHTER). We first introduce RICHTER's multi-layer architecture and design an action tree that considers all feasible resources provided by peers, edge, and CDN servers for serving peer requests with minimum latency and maximum quality. We then formulate the problem as an optimization model executed at the edge of the network. We present an Online Learning (OL) approach that leverages an unsupervised Self Organizing Map (SOM) to (i) alleviate the time complexity issue of the optimization model and (ii) make it a suitable solution for large-scale scenarios, by enabling decisions for groups of requests instead of for single requests. Finally, we implement the RICHTER framework, conduct our experiments on a large-scale cloud-based testbed including 350 HAS players, and compare its effectiveness with baseline systems. The experimental results illustrate that RICHTER outperforms baseline schemes in terms of users' Quality of Experience (QoE), latency, and network utilization, by at least 59%, 39%, and 70% respectively.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:33:58","2023-09-19 10:33:58","","1911-1917","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted subjective tests (N=31); our results indicate that MCG is affected differently by QoS attributes such as packet loss (PL), round trip time (RTT) and jitter compared to cloud games and online mobile games. We identify that RTT values above 100 milliseconds significantly impact users' QoE, measured via the mean opinion score (MOS).

This paper proposes a location-dependent multi-antenna coded caching - based content delivery scheme tailored specifically for wireless immersive viewing applications. First, a novel memory allocation process incentivizes the content relevant to the identified wireless bottleneck areas. This enables a trade-off between local and global caching gains and results in unequal fractions of location-dependent multimedia content cached by each user. Then, a novel packet generation process is carried out during the subsequent delivery phase, given the asymmetric cache placement. During this phase, the number of packets transmitted to each user is the same, while the sizes of the packets are proportional to the corresponding location-dependent cache ratios. In this regard, each user is served with location-specific content using joint multicast beamforming and a multi-rate modulation scheme that simultaneously benefits from global caching and spatial multiplexing gains. Numerical experiments and mathematical analysis demonstrate significant performance gains compared to the state-of-the-art.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:00","2023-09-19 10:34:00","","1930-1935","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Internet-of-things (IoT) based wireless sensor networking is an interesting and vital technology that has seen substantial growth in recent years. Agricultural applications are one of the fields where it is extensively used and effectively implemented to manage irrigation requirements. In smart agriculture, reference evapotranspiration ($ET_{0}$) has a great significance in determining the precise crop water requirement. Hence, accurate estimation of $ET_{0}$ is critical to avoid under or over-irrigation without compromising the agricultural productivity. This paper presents Genetic algorithm (GA) based optimized Long short term memory (LSTM) model (LSTM-GA) to estimate reference evapotranspiration ($ET_{0}$) using climate data acquired by IoT based wireless sensor networks (WSN). Specifically, we examine the temporal property of climate data by proposing a systematic way of determining the time window size for the LSTM model using Genetic algorithm. The climate variables include daily maximum temperature ($T_{max}$), minimum temperature ($T_{min}$), solar radiation ($R_{s}$), sunshine hours (SSH), wind speed ($U_{2}$), relative humidity (Rh), and vapor pressure (Vp) of Ludhiana station.

Existing Edge SLAM approaches incur relatively high delays for offloading, resulting in high failure probabilities, i.e., low reliability, for commonly used public SLAM datasets. We discovered that two parameters which had not previously been studied in detail, namely the number of features and the number of keyframes that are bundled for a local map update, play a critical role in the offloading delay. Also, previous approaches updated the local map in the mobile device in a serial manner, incurring map update latencies. We study the numbers of features and bundled keyframes in detail and we parallelize the local map update. We find that judicious parameter settings, namely relatively small numbers of features (750 per frame) and bundled keyframes (1, i.e., effectively no bundling), reduce the map update latency to less than half compared to the previously common settings (1000 features per frame and 6 keyframes used for a map update).

The agents use time-of-flight (ToF) measurements obtained from transmissions of a beacon signal by the asset to estimate the asset's position, but the estimates are noisy due to clock drift at the agents' local clocks. The clock drift can be reduced by having the asset and network of agents perform a distributed synchronization process; however, synchronization and localization cannot be performed simultaneously because the clock states are not well defined during synchronization and due to constraints on the radios' communication resources. The problem of optimizing when the agents should perform sensing or synchronization is formulated as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) with continuous observations. Table-based Q-learning is used to search for an optimal policy on the belief space of the POMDP, but some form of approximation must be used because the belief space is a high -dimensional continuous space. We compare the performance of two approaches: 1) in replicated Q-learning, we learn a $Q$ function that is a linear function of the continuous beliefs; 2) in triple-Q learning, the beliefs are replaced by a model with fewer parameters, and quantization is used on a continuous parameter. Simulations are used to compare the performance of these methods with the approach that is most commonly used, which is using periodic synchronization at an optimized, fixed rate.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:01","2023-09-19 10:34:01","","1960-1965","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, relaying on using the emerging technology; intelligent reflective surface (IRS) to reconfigure wireless signal propagation is considered the best solution that can address the mentioned challenge. Additionally, choosing the position of the IRS is not an easy task as the clients are mobile. Hence, there is a need for an efficient model to elect the best positions of the IRSs for a better network performance. In this work, two fold model is proposed to provide an automated solution to optimize IRS positions.

Whereas the second one is based on the reinforcement learning optimization (RLO) with complex encoder and decoder network architecture to provide fast learning of the MILP results with a low mean square error.

This is, in turn, relevant to optimize the frequency of the exchanges, especially for resource constrained (e.g., energy-limited) sensors. Most investigations on the subject assume that the transmitter can leverage knowledge of the age of information at the receiver side to decide when to send data, even when the communication channel is unreliable. In reality, tracking the outcome of the updates would require additional consumption of resources to acquire a feedback. We investigate the optimal schedule of updates over a finite time horizon for a resource-constrained sensor that is allowed to perform a limited number of updates, as typical of IoT devices. We discuss the role of the feedback from the receiver, and whether it is convenient to ask for it whenever this causes additional energy consumption and consequently allows the transmission of a lower number of updates.

Most cyber ranges and testbeds focus on traditional network systems and few incorporate cyber-physical components. When they do, the cyber-physical components are often simulated.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for greedy nodes detection based on an unsupervised machine learning method. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and to prove the limits of this technique, several attack scenarios were carried out into cooja, and different simulation parameters were taken into account such as the number of packets sent, the energy consumption, and radio status.

As smart devices generate and transmit confidential and sensitive data, in these cases, data leakage can lead in many cases to drastic consequences. These types of attacks are called compromised attacks and the U2R and R2L subcategories are typical examples. Despite various intrusion detection systems designed for detecting compromised attacks, many of them are deficient and suboptimum due to the highly sophisticated behavior of these attacks that mimic normal ones, as well as the rarity of occurrence, and lack of training records keep this area inconclusive. Therefore, this paper presents an ensemble-based intrusion detection system to identify rare hard-to-detect attacks (U2R and R2L) in IoT networks. The ensemble is composed of two main tiers. Each tier consists of a major improved KNN classifier driven by multiple auxiliary classical KNN classifiers. the combined responses of these detection tires are fused to provide the optimal detection performance for minority attacks. The experimental analysis unveiled that the proposed system achieved a high detection accuracy reaches up to 96.65% and 100% for R2L and U2R respectively along with Cohen's kappa coefficient reaches up to 0.9778 and 0.996, which confirms the reliability and robustness of the proposed system to be deployed in loT networks.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:03","2023-09-19 10:34:03","","1990-1995","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we propose the design and implementation of two security-aware protocols for node replacements and incremental software updates in IIoT. The node replacement protocol ensures the legitimacy of newly added replacement sensors by coordinating an efficient key management procedure to refresh their cryptographic keying material without the need of resource-intensive public-key cryptographic techniques. This is done by leveraging private secret sharing protocols and relying on the already established security associations between the IoT gateway and neighboring sensor nodes. The node update protocol supports multi-component software updates on the IIoT sensors and ensures their authenticity using probabilistic set membership data structures. This results in major reductions in network traffic overhead and protocol convergence times compared to traditional integrity enforcement approaches at the expense of minimal false positives probability. Moreover, the node update protocol realizes an incremental component loading and integrity verification mechanism on the IIoT sensors that lessens their storage requirements and avoids any superfluous operation intermission.

Indeed, gateway-centric allocation strategies look for the optimal configuration of the transmission parameters and send them to thousands of end-devices through MAC commands on the downlink. However, most of these allocation strategies are validated either by simulation or mathematical models. In this paper, we discuss the fundamentals and the requirements of the MAC commands transmission on the downlink. Our design allows IoT applications to transmit frames on the downlink hitherto reserved for MAC configuration commands, makes easier the implementation of new spreading factor assignment strategies, and provides an experimental framework for Downlink performance analysis.

Although various solutions based on technologies of established consumer goods, e.g., Bluetooth or WiFi, have been proposed and tested, the published accuracy results fail to make these technologies relevant for many use cases. This stems from the challenging environments for positioning, especially in aircraft cabins, which is mainly due to the geometries, many obstacles, and highly reflective materials. To address these issues, we propose to evaluate in this work an Ultra-Wideband (UWB)-based IPS via a measurement campaign performed in a real aircraft cabin. We first illustrate the difficulties that an IPS faces in an aircraft cabin, by studying the signal propagation effects which were measured. We then investigate the ranging and localization accuracies of our IPS.

To this end, we present LTElike, a novel backscatter design that can page tags to initiate LTE service requests.

How to reduce the delay with the finite blocklength coding in the URLLC system is a challenging issue. In this paper, a Lyapunov drift-based scheduling scheme is presented for short-packet transmission systems. Specifically, a scheduling scheme is designed to determine the transmission rate and maximize the system throughput with Lyapunov optimization. The average power constraint can be tackled with the virtual power queue method. So that the short-packet transmission problem can be formulated as a univariate optimization problem, which is non-convex.

However, it has been shown that generating ML-based models in a centralized way consumes a massive quantity of network resources, such as CPU/memory and bandwidth, which may represent a critical issue in such networks. To avoid this problem, the new concept of Federated Learning (FL) emerged to build ML-based models in a distributed and collaborative way. In such an approach, the set of nodes, e.g., vehicles or gNodeB, collaborate to create a global ML model trained across these multiple decentralized nodes; each one with its respective data samples that are not shared with any other nodes. In this way, FL enables, on the one hand, data privacy since sharing data with a central location is not always feasible and, on the other hand, network overhead reduction. This paper designs a new IDS for C-V2X networks based on FL. It leverages edge computing to not only build a prediction model in a distributed way, but also to enable low latency intrusion detection. Moreover, we build our FL-based IDS on top of well-know CIC-IDS2018 dataset, that includes the main network attacks. Noting that, we first perform a feature engineering on the dataset using the ANOVA method to consider only the most informative features. Simulation results show the efficiency of our system compared to the existing solutions in terms of attack detection accuracy while reducing the network resource consumption.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:07","2023-09-19 10:34:07","","2080-2085","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While these tech-nologies enrich the driving experience, they also bring a series of vulnerable interfaces to the vehicle. These interfaces can be used by hackers to attack other nodes of in-vehicle network that lack authentication and encryption. For this, researchers design scheme to encrypt and authenticate messages to protect in-vehicle networks, but this scheme would occupy the bandwidth resources of in-vehicle network. Therefore, researchers propose parameter monitoring-based intrusion detection system (IDS), information theory-based IDS, and fingerprint-based IDS, which do not occupy bandwidth. However, most IDSs either cannot locate the source of the attack, cannot detect aperiodic frames, or need to know the non-public mapping between electronic control units (ECUs) and identifiers (IDs) of in-vehicle network. To solve these weaknesses, we propose a novel IDS that establishes voltage fingerprints for each ID. This system can detect period and aperiodic malicious frames and locate the source of attack without knowing the mapping between ECUs and IDs. The experimental results on actual vehicles demonstrate that our scheme is robust against real scenarios.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:08","2023-09-19 10:34:08","","2098-2103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To optimally reduce the resulting redundancy, the dynamic features of contents, clients, and network elements must be entangled with those of the network's topology. Inspired by Quantum Field Theory and Newtonian Mechanics, we developed a model to comprehensively describe the clients' interactions with contents, which generate a “gravitational force” on the latter moving them toward their requesters. The “gravity” is then transformed into a topological metric to confine the replication of contents spatially to an optimum subset of caches. This Interaction-based Caching (IC) uses the couplings of contents and clients to regulate the kinematics of contents in the network deterministically. To maximize the IC's performance, the interaction terms must be adapted to the capacity and betweenness centrality degree of caches and the contents' popularity. The proposed algorithms are extensively analyzed and evaluated in various simulation scenarios showing that the IC significantly outperforms comparable caching strategies in terms of hit ratio.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:09","2023-09-19 10:34:09","","2104-2109","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current research focuses on ICN pricing to analyze the pricing mechanism on the internet service provider (ISP) side and the corresponding market equilibrium results.

The model assumes the existence of one single CP operator, which will be very different from future deployment scenarios. Multiple CPs will introduce competition and stimulate end users to use ICN networks and ISPs to deploy ICN networks. Moreover, the relationship between CPs is not only competitive but also cooperative. This paper focuses on the complex relationship of competition and cooperation among multiple CPs, solves the non-cooperative game model based on game theory, and studies the interaction between cache and pricing strategies of ICN entities. The optimal cache share of ISPs and the optimal pricing of ISPs and CPs are obtained by establishing the optimal utility function of each entity. Finally, numerical analysis is performed to derive the utility function of ICN entities as the critical pricing and caching parameters change, while verifying the consistency with the equilibrium solution.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:09","2023-09-19 10:34:09","","2110-2115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, microservices deployment in edge and in-network devices is more expensive than the cloud. Additionally, several works do not consider the main requirements of microservice architecture, such as service registry, failure detection, and each microservice's specific database. This paper investigates the problem of placing components (i.e. microservices and their corresponding databases) while considering physical nodes' failure and the distance to service registries. We propose a Components-aware Microservices Placement for In-Network Computing Cloud-Edge Continuum (CaMP-INC). We formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem with the objective of cost minimization. Due to the problem's $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness, we propose a heuristic solution. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed solution CaMP-INC reduces the total cost by 15.8% on average and has a superior performance in terms of latency minimization compared to benchmarks.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:09","2023-09-19 10:34:09","","2116-2121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the critical concerns raised by this trend toward consolidation of infrastructure, traffic, users, and services is the concentration of many essential Internet resources among a small number of providers. Some consequences of such consolidation (single points of failure) were exposed in 2016 and 2019 in large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on two DNS providers. In this paper, we study the Domain Name System (DNS) industry's consolidation in light of multiple country-code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs) and generic top-level domains (gTLDs) by resolving and evaluating the authoritative name-servers (NS) for all domains in each TLD during five years. We show that, the Top 5 DNS providers account for more than 20% of all domains and, more shockingly, the Top 100 providers account for about 80% of the entire examined IPv4 domain namespace. We also reveal that domains in certain TLDs are highly concentrated in the hands of a few providers. For example, Estonia's (.ee) Top 5 providers will hold around 78% of the total TLD namespace in 2021. Additionally, we examine the domain concentration per TLD in terms of provider location origin. We notice a strong presence of local companies in Europe's top-level domains, emphasizing the Russian Federation.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:10","2023-09-19 10:34:10","","2122-2127","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To increase the network performance, companies migrate their existing network to a network with a new technology. Finding an efficient optimization algorithm is an important challenge in the network migration. In this paper, the network migration problem is considered as a set of circuit migration problems in which multiple technicians simultaneously migrate the endpoints of circuits in order to minimize the average latency and average technician travel cost. While average latency indicates how fast the sites can be upgraded, average travel cost estimates the required cost for modernizing the network. First, We derive binary linear program and binary quadratic program formulations for average latency and average technician travel cost, respectively. Then we use the linear scalarization method to obtain a multi-objective optimization problem for simultaneously minimizing both costs. Our approach for solving the derived multi-objective optimization problem is based on converting it to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO) using the penalty method. Subsequently, we exploit the third generation of Fujitsu Digital Annealer which is a hybrid system of hardware and software to minimize the derived QUBO. To investigate the performance of our proposed method, we study extensive network migration instances on the 75-node CONUS network topology. Simulation results indicate that both costs can efficiently be optimized using our proposed method. We also directly solve the obtained multi-objective optimization problem with Gurobi solver. The comparison results show that our proposed method outperforms the Gurobi solver.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:10","2023-09-19 10:34:10","","2128-2133","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we design novel algorithms to synthesize and label training data for the substitute classifier used by the BB-AdA.

The results show that with our self-taught BB-AdA, an attacker can interact with an MLy-NA system quietly and efficiently to train itself adaptively, generate well-crafted adversarial samples to mislead the target classifiers in different ML architectures and severely affect their performance on anomaly detection, and disturb the operation of MLy-NA in the hard-to-detect manner.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:11","2023-09-19 10:34:11","","2134-2139","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such cooperation can be constrained by limited visibility as confidential information, such as network topology, resource availability, etc., may not be disclosed among these entities due to regulatory policies. We study a DCP-carrier cooperation-based service restoration scheme during a disaster with the aid of a third-party mediator, namely a Provider Neutral Exchange (PNE). We propose a novel resource-driven demand-matching strategy to restore DCP services. When multiple DCPs compete for network resources (due to post-disaster resource crunch), resource balancing by PNE can achieve fair and efficient service restoration. To allow flexibility in demand-resource matching, DCPs generate multiple sets of connection requests and define varying priorities and bandwidth degradations for each request. Carriers evaluate the DCP requests and provide feedback (e.g., whether a request can be satisfied or not) based on their available resources. We present an eight-phase DCP-carrier cooperation framework, with each phase employing individual sub-tasks carried out by DCPs, carriers, and PNE. Results under different disaster scenarios show that our strategy significantly improves DCP service restoration, incurring less restoration time.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:12","2023-09-19 10:34:12","","2151-2156","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only one UAV is allowed to forward its data to the BS in each time slot. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the longterm age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the UAVs' trajectories and scheduling strategies. To simplify this problem, we model the dynamics of the UAVs' data buffer and AoI statuses by queueing systems, and propose a novel AoI-aware Adaptation scheme. This scheme allows us to transform the multistage dynamic programming problem into per-slot scheduling and trajectory planning sub-problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework.

One of the main goals of integrating UAVs into wireless networks is to deploy UAVs in such a way that user expectations are met with the fewest number of UAVs. To achieve this aim, the coverage area of each UAV should include as many users as possible. Furthermore, the resources assigned to the backhaul links for such UAV deployments must fulfill the requirements of users served by each UAV. In this paper the goal is to position the least number of UAVs in a 3D position to cover cellular network users. To provide appropriate quality of service, we consider a maximum path loss allowed for the network. The path loss of potential links is affected by the propagation environment and might vary depending on network structure. To reflect this uncertainty, path loss is expressed as a random variable with a probability distribution based on environmental characteristics. As a result, we're dealing with an optimization problem with uncertain information. We use stochastic programming to work with uncertain information and formulate the UAV positioning and data rate assignment problem.

To enable demand-oriented distributed services, this paper investigates the relationship between capability and security in blockchain from the perspective of block propagation and forking problem. First, a Markov chain is introduced to analyze the gossiping-based block propagation among edge servers, which aims to derive block propagation delay and forking probability. Then, we study the impact of forking on blockchain capability and security metrics, in terms of transaction throughput, confirmation delay, fault tolerance, and the probability of malicious modification. The analytical results show that with the adjustment of block generation rate, transaction throughput improves at the sacrifice of fault tolerance, and vice versa.

In traditional FL paradigm, local models are usually required to be homogeneous for aggregation to achieve an accurate global model. Moreover, considerable communication cost and training time may be incurred in resource-constrained edge networks due to a large number of UEs participating in model transmission and the large size of transmitted models. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective training schemes for heterogeneous FL models, while reducing communication cost as well as training time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive quantization scheme based on ensemble distillation (AQeD) for FL to facilitate personalized quantized model training over heterogeneous local models with different size, structure, and quantization level, etc. Specifically, we design an augmented loss function by jointly considering distillation loss function, quantization values and available wireless resources, where UEs train their local personalized machine learning models and send the quantized models to a server. Based on local quantized models, the server first performs global aggregation for cluster ensembles and then sends the aggregated model of the cluster back to the participating UEs. Numerical results show that our proposed AQeD scheme can significantly reduce communication cost as well as training time in comparison with some known state-of-the-art solutions.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:15","2023-09-19 10:34:15","","2194-2199","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a task request, it is usually necessary to interconnect multiple containers to build a Container Cluster (CC), and then deploy it to edge service nodes with relatively limited resources. However, the increasingly complex and time-varying nature of tasks brings great challenges to optimally deploying CC on edge nodes. From the perspective of edge service provider, this paper regards the charges for various resources occupied by providing services as revenue, and regards the service efficiency and energy consumption generated by providing services as cost, then formulate an integer optimization model to describe the optimal deployment of CC on distributed edge nodes. Different from the heuristic-based methods adopted in existing works, we introduce Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract features from the logical topological link relationships among containers in CCs and use them as the input of the solution framework to improve the solution quality. Compared with other related algorithms, the results show that the method proposed in this paper can obtain better solution quality and maintain acceptable solution efficiency under the same edge cloud environment. The improved system revenue for edge service provider can be further obtained.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:16","2023-09-19 10:34:16","","2212-2217","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, offloading a task to the nearest MEC server may not be the optimal solution due to the limited computing resources of the MEC server. Thus, jointly optimizing the offloading decision and resource management is critical, but yet to be explored. Here, offloading decision refers to where to offload a task and resource management implies how much computing resource in an MEC server is allocated to a task. By considering the waiting time of a task in the communication and computing queues (which are ignored by most of the existing works) as well as tasks priorities, we propose the Deep reinforcement lEarning based offloading deCision and rEsource managemeNT (DECENT) algorithm, which leverages the advantage actor critic method to optimize the offloading decision and computing resource allocation for each arriving task in real-time such that the cumulative weighted response time can be minimized.

Secondly, the multiple tasks segmentation problem is further decomposed into single task segmentation problem, where the optimal task segmentation ratio function is proposed and proved. Thirdly, the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) algorithm is applied to choose computation node for subtasks parallelly in an online manner for the time-varying network.

Besides, the exclusiveness of GPU device may cause the straggler problem and hence long inference time. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used in such task scheduling problems. But the delayed reward during the training may slow the convergence speed or even result in non-convergence. To this end, in this paper, we design an improved reinforcement learning based algorithm, called DRM-DQL, to achieve a layer-aware DNN inference task scheduling. We first analyze and model the layer-wise inference task scheduling problem by deep Q-learning. Then, a delayed reward matching strategy is proposed for matching the global reward value to the immediate reward value, which help the algorithm to get the right experience in DNN layer scheduling.

However, the fetal DUS signals from the transducers can be corrupted by several interference sources such as maternal and fetal movements, which makes FHR estimation using fetal DUS signals challenging. Fetal DUS signal quality assessment (SQA) can help to remove or interpolate unreliable FHRs estimated from noisy signals to improve the accuracy of FHR estimation. There are some existing approaches for fetal DUS SQA, and most of these approaches with high accuracy are based on supervised learning-based algorithms and human-defined properties. Nonetheless, the fetal DUS datasets with quality-level annotations are limited, and human-defined properties place a limitation on mining more deep information related to signal quality in fetal DUS signals.

Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) is one of the methods to detect a heartbeat. Fetal arrhythmia can be detected based on the heartbeat detection results from FECG signals such as heartbeat intervals. However, the accuracy of arrhythmia detection easily degrades depending on the accuracy of heartbeat detection. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based fetal arrhythmia detection method using FECG signals. Recently, arrhythmia detection methods using adult ECG signals have achieved a high arrhythmia detection accuracy based on deep learning. Motivated by this fact, in the proposed method, the acquired FECG signals are segmented, and the segments are input into a deep learning model that classifies them into normal or arrhythmia ones. Based on the classification results of multiple segments, a subject is judged as a healthy or arrhythmia subject. Each segment of the training data is divided into three categories based on the estimated heartbeat interval: (i) normal, (ii) arrhythmia, and (iii) a segment that could be both normal and arrhythmia. Only segments labeled as normal or arrhythmia are used for training a deep learning model to achieve a higher classification accuracy of the model. Through these procedures, the proposed method detects fetal arrhythmia with fewer effects of heartbeat detection results. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could outperform the conventional methods with heartbeat detection and feature detection in terms of accuracy, specificity, and recall.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:21","2023-09-19 10:34:21","","2266-2271","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In spectrum sharing, the initialized licensed spectrum of each MN O is divided into a reserved and shared spectrum. The reserved spectrum is for the private use of an MNO, while the shared spectrum of all MNOs forms a spectrum pool which will be dynamically used by MNO who requires an additional spectrum. However, the spectrum pool management problem significantly affects the efficiency of spectrum sharing among multi-MNO. In this paper, we formulate this problem into a non-linear programming problem that aims to maximize the average data rate of UEs, which subscribe to an MNO sending the spectrum request event, of all events from all MNOs. We propose an event-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning based spectrum sharing mechanism (EDRL-SSM) that utilizes a spectrum pool manager to effectively manage the spectrum pool to achieve long-term optimization of data rate performance of UEs. The spectrum pool manager intelligently allocates spectrum pool resource for each incoming spectrum request event. The proposed EDRL-SSM fully utilizes a DRL technique, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to deal with stochastic spectrum request event arrivals in the spectrum pool manager.

Data-driven solutions, e.g., Neural Network (NN) based forecasting methods, have been proven to be effective only when sufficient data is available. However, Base Stations (BSs) have limited data in the real world, since big data for communication networks could be extremely expensive to collect, store, and migrate. Therefore, most existing traffic forecasting methods have limited accuracy in reality due to the lack of big data. To tackle this problem, our key observation is that, despite the data “amount” in a BS is limited, the data “source” is rich and diverse, i.e., in addition to Internet traffic logs, there are logs of Call and SMS. More importantly, our analysis shows a high correlation between different sources, which can be utilized to improve the forecasting accuracy. Motivated by this, we introduce AdaSource, a Multi-Source Adaptive Feature Boosting approach, which utilizes data source correlations for accurate traffic forecasting even on data-limited BSs. The core idea of AdaSource is a novel two-branch NN structure that adaptively trains multiple Encoder-Decoders for refining different data sources and multiple Encoder-Predictors for utilizing data source correlations to improve the accuracy. The experiments on a real-world dataset show that AdaSource improves the forecasting accuracy by up to 30.14%, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:25","2023-09-19 10:34:25","","2316-2321","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This topic has received significant attention, and several reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, in which BSs and UEs are cast as agents, are available with the aim of learning a communication policy based on agents' local observations. However, current approaches are typically overfitted to the environment they are trained in, and lack robustness against unseen conditions, failing to generalize in different environments. To overcome this problem, in this work, instead of learning a policy in the high dimensional and redundant observation space, we leverage the concept of observation abstraction (OA) rooted in extracting useful information from the environment. This in turn allows learning communication protocols that are more robust and with much better generalization capabilities than current baselines. To learn the abstracted information from observations, we propose an architecture based on autoencoder (AE) and imbue it into a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) framework. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of leveraging abstraction when learning protocols by generalizing across environments, in terms of number of UEs, number of data packets to transmit, and channel conditions.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:26","2023-09-19 10:34:26","","2322-2327","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper addresses the scalability issue by partitioning RIS into sub-surfaces, so as to optimize the phase shifts in sub-surface levels to reduce complexity. In the proposed design, each sub-surface employs a linear phase variation structure to anomalously reflect the incident signal to a desired direction. We formulate the achievable rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the structured RIS phase shifts. Then, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the system with an infinitely large number of transceiver antennas and reflecting elements.

Existing RIS-assisted PKG methods are mainly based on the idealistic assumption of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel model at both the transmitter and the RIS. However, the i.i.d. model is inaccurate for a typical RIS in an isotropic scattering environment. Also, neglecting the existence of channel spatial correlation would degrade the PKG performance. In this paper, we establish a general spatially correlated channel model in multi-antenna systems and propose a new PKG framework based on the transmit and the reflective beamforming at the base station (BS) and the RIS. Specifically, we derive a closed-form expression for characterizing the key generation rate (KGR) and obtain a globally optimal solution of the beamformers to maximize the KGR. Furthermore, we analyze the KGR performance difference between the one adopting the assumption of the i.i.d. model and that of the spatially correlated model. It is found that the beamforming designed for the correlated model outperforms that for the i.i.d. model while the KGR gain increases with the channel correlation. Simulation results show that compared to existing methods based on the i.i.d. fading model, our proposed method achieves about 5 dB performance gain when the BS antenna correlation $\rho$ is 0.3 and the RIS element spacing is half of the wavelength.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:28","2023-09-19 10:34:28","","2352-2357","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data compression is a widely adopted technique that enables higher energy efficiency, lower latency, and better bandwidth utilization. Unfortunately, the current compression techniques are mainly designed for human-type communications (HTC). Therefore, they consider the reconstruction fidelity, rather than the accuracy of inferred decisions, as the sole performance metric. In this work, we propose a novel encoder for data compression in mMTC communications, which is termed Distillation Encoder (DE). Unlike prior work, the design of the proposed DE aims to achieve high compression ratios while preserving the accuracy of the inferred decisions. DE inherits the knowledge of a large teacher model (trained on the raw data) through knowledge distillation.

In SPS-NOMA, multiple users (e.g., cars or pedestrians) simultaneously broadcast their packets, i.e., a packet collision, and each receiver (i.e., each of their surrounding users) aims to decode the packets by using the successive interference cancellation (SIC). However, some re-ceivers may undergo collision errors at collisions even in SPS-NOMA due to spatial location relationships between the receivers and simultaneously transmitting users, called collision users. To reveal such spatial performance characteristics, this paper derives closed-form expressions of the packet reception ratio (PRR) at the receiver deployed on each coordinate point in a spatial area. Our analysis showed the spatial distributions of the PRR in an area, and SPS-NOMA achieved the required PRR in a 50% more wide area than the existing ASC-V2X without SIC. Additionally, our analysis provided the limitations of SPS-NOMA, and specifically, receivers experienced 65 % lower PRRs than the peak around the bisector created by collision users.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:49","2023-09-19 10:34:49","","1205-1210","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that learns the precoding vector of the base station (BS) and the IRS phase shift from the wireless environment to address this problem. We develop a beam-pattern-based learning framework for this algorithm that indirectly maps the wireless environment to the phase shift to manage the large state-action space caused by the multiple elements of the BS and IRS. Based on the simulation results, the proposed algorithm can learn from the environment and establish a transmission strategy that improves the user's transmission rate.

Generally, radio strength measurements are collected to construct fine-resolution radio maps for analysis. However, certain protected areas are not accessible for measurement due to physical constraints and security considerations, leading to blanked spaces on a radio map. Non-uniformly spaced measurement and uneven observation resolution make it more difficult for radio map estimation and spectrum planning in protected areas. This work explores the distribution of radio spectrum strengths and proposes an exemplar-based approach to reconstruct missing areas on a radio map. Instead of taking generic image processing approaches, we leverage radio propagation models to determine directions of region filling and develop two different schemes to estimate the missing radio signal power.

In this context, we present an approach to solve the problem using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where the objective is to jointly minimize the number of computing resources used and maximize the vRAN centralization level.

However, the uncertainties in the road-traffic and AVs' wireless connections can severely impair timely decision-making. It is thus critical to simultaneously optimize the AVs' network selection and driving policies in order to minimize road collisions while maximizing the communication data rates. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to characterize efficient network selection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network (VNet) operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz (THz) frequencies. The proposed framework is designed to (i) maximize the traffic flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration) from autonomous driving perspective, and (ii) maximize the data rates and minimize handoffs by jointly controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics and network selection from telecommunication perspective. We cast this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a deep Q-learning based solution to optimize the actions such as acceleration, deceleration, lane-changes, and AV-base station assignments for a given AV's state. The AV's state is defined based on the velocities and communication channel states of AVs. Numerical results demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle's motion dynamics, handoffs, and the communication data rate.

The distributed framework consists of independent QL agents, attempting to reach their own individual objectives. The agents need to learn using a sufficient number of training steps before they converge to the optimal performance. After convergence, they can take reliable management actions. However, the scalability of QL could be severely hindered, particularly in the convergence time - when the number of QL agents increases. To overcome the scalability issue of QL, in this paper, we explore the potentials of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, a function approximation-based method. Results show that DQN outperforms QL by at least 37% in terms of convergence time.

As a result, the multiple 6G network stakeholders can perform a role in a marketplace as service providers or consumers. Blockchain and DLT have immutability, transparency, and decentralized ledgers, making them critical in a future-generation network where various administrative domains are controlled by separate operators and resource providers to share resources (virtual network functions, services, or slices). Similarly, an auction-based approach based on the blockchain can eliminate intermediaries while ensuring transparency to increase competitiveness in such an environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a solution based on blockchain, considering both approaches (i.e., marketplace and auction). Furthermore, we use IOTA Tangle and IPFS to reduce the transaction and gas costs, which is one of the challenges for Ethereum-based use cases. We also provide experimental evaluations of our use case to analyze the results. It is observed that both options expand the consumer's possibilities to choose, and creating smart contracts adds trust. Moreover, the potential advantages of the proposed solutions are demonstrated through emulation results as a comparison to the traditional ways of doing such agreements between inter-provider domains. We measure transaction latency and the maximum latency observed in our proposed approach is ≈ 25ms. Similarly, the average response time for the Ethereum-based approach is double our proposed approach's average response time. Consequently, the services are completed relatively fast with less latency and faster response time. Moreover, it is observed that in ≈ 2000s, up to 30 services can be completed in a marketplace approach and up to 20 ~ 25 services in the auction. Lastly, the results also explain that by using IOTA-EVM, we can have feeless transactions, and IPFS helps reduce the storage cost up to ≈ 80%.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:54","2023-09-19 10:34:54","","1271-1277","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LiFi networks are expected to provide full data coverage while also satisfying illumination requirements in indoor environments. Thus, the optimized placement of LiFi Access Points (APs) is of utmost importance. Extending the commonly applied 2D placement, we include the height of the AP, which is an important factor to consider due to the short range of LiFi and limited Field of View (FoV) of the receivers. To this end, we propose a 3D LiFi Access Point placement framework that formulates the placement as a multi-objective optimization problem minimizing the number of APs and maximizing the sum rate while providing a guaranteed minimum rate and illumination level. Since the exact positions of users are unknown during network planning and change dynamically after deployment, the probability distribution of user occurrence is considered in the optimization. This results in the network performance being maximized in areas where users are likely to be present. This optimization problem is solved with the proposed multi-objective genetic algorithm. The framework is evaluated with simulations and the results show that the height of the AP greatly influences the network performance. We conclude that a free choice of the height of each AP results in an average rate that is significantly better than the rate achievable when all APs are placed at the same height.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:55","2023-09-19 10:34:55","","1278-1283","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most existing precoding algorithms require a dedicated baseband chain for each light emitting diode (LED), which may result in high energy consumption and hardware complexity, especially when LEDs are densely deployed. To solve this issue, a successive interference cancellation-based precoding scheme with sub-connected architecture (SIC-SA) is proposed, where each baseband chain is connected to an LED sub-array. In this case, since the SIC-based precoding can only determine the signal of each baseband chain for an LED sub-array, the electrical/optical power of each LED must be jointly optimized to alleviate the spatial correlation among individual LEDs. This joint SIC-based precoding, power allocation and direct current offset design problem is formulated as an achievable sum rate maximization problem under dimming control and electrical power constraints. To solve this problem, the original problem is separated into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, the SIC-based precoding is calculated by successive null space computation. With the obtained SIC-based precoding, the second subproblem optimizes the power allocation and direct-current offset. Finally, these two subproblems are iteratively solved to obtain a convergent solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SIC-SA achieves 0.1306 bps/Hz/W and 0.1340 bps/Hz/W improvements in terms of energy efficiency compared to minimum mean square error precoding with fully-connected architecture (FA) and zero-forcing precoding with FA, respectively, when the signal-to-noise ratio is 30 dB.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:55","2023-09-19 10:34:55","","1290-1295","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid dimming (HD) scheme with MIMO VLC transceiver design, which jointly optimizes transmit and receive antenna selection (TRAS), cell clustering and precoding (TRASP-HD) for MC MU-MIMO VLC systems. In this scheme, a sum-rate maximization problem under the dimming level and illumination uniformity is formulated and solved by being divided into two sub-problems. In particular, The first sub-problem is on TRAS and cell formation based on the criterion of sum-rate maximization under the illumination uniformity constraint. With the same goal, the second sub-problem is on optimizing the precoding matrices of each cell. Finally, these two sub-problems are iteratively solved to obtain a convergent solution. Simulation results verify that in a typical indoor scenario, the mean bandwidth efficiency of TRASP-HD scheme is 2.36 bit/s/Hz higher than the conventional MC MU-MIMO system.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:56","2023-09-19 10:34:56","","1302-1307","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fast and reliable beam alignment is essential for efficient beam-based mmWave communications between UAVs and the base stations (BSs). Learning-based approaches may greatly reduce the overhead by leveraging UAV data, such as position, to identify the optimal beam directions. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework for UAV-BS beam alignment using the hierarchical deep Q-Network (hDQN) in a mmWave radio setting. We consider uplink communications where the UAV hovers around 5G new radio (NR) BS coverage area, with three dimensional (3D) beams under diverse channel conditions. A BS serves with learnt beam-pairs in an uplink manner upon every communication request from UAV inside the multi-location environment. Compared to our prior DQN-based method, the proposed hDQN framework uses the location information and the fixed spatial arrangement of the antenna elements to reduce the beam search complexity and maximize the data rates efficiently. The results show that our proposed hDQN-based framework converges faster than the DQN-based approach with an average overall training reduction of 43% and, is generic to multi-location environments across different uniform planar array (UPA) configurations and diverse channel conditions.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:34:57","2023-09-19 10:34:57","","1308-1313","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In ALF, the OWN problem is solved in two co-related stages: the demand prediction stage and the proactive deployment stage. We first design a dual transformer network (DTN) to forecast the wireless traffic in the demand prediction stage. To decrease the complexity of DTN, we employ a patch embedding method and a modified self-attention scheme to improve the efficiency.

The concept of cellular-based UAM (cUAM) provides a promising solution where aerial vehicles are regarded as new aerial users, sharing the cellular spectrum with existing terrestrial users. However, with new characteristics and demands of aerial users, the severity of spectrum scarcity becomes more prominent and new spectrum management solutions are needed.

To this end, service mesh provides a potential solution in efficient microservices management. However, as a traditional cloud-oriented architecture, it can not be applied into edge computing directly since the centralized controller policy.

Such a DAG-based blockchain system shows higher scalability as multiple locations are available in the ledger for new message attachment. To decide an attachment location, a popular type of tip selection algorithms follow an approach using weighted random walks on the DAG ledger. In a burst message arrival scenario, however, a processing node deployed at edge using such a method may become a bottleneck because sequentially repeating random walks significantly increases processing delay. In this paper, we propose a new tip selection algorithm for the burst message arrival scenario on an edge node. Our solution abandons the weighted random walk approach, instead, with similar efforts we transfer to calculate in advance the tip selection probability distribution of the DAG ledger. Such a new scheme reduces tip selection to a probability distribution sampling task, which can be done extremely fast. We implement our solution and demonstrate the benefits of our approach by comparing with the random walk approach. We believe our attempt can effectively mitigate the congestion at the edge node and inspire tip selection algorithm design with a new vision for DAG-based blockchain systems.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:35:01","2023-09-19 10:35:01","","1373-1378","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once outsiders personate accounts or insiders conduct illegal operations, the data security in teleworking with traditional border protection will be broken. Therefore, it is necessary to implement fine-grained and dynamic access control to protect data from malicious access. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is ideal, where authorization is performed through attributes and rules. On this basis, risk assessment, context awareness, and machine learning are supplemented for dynamic access control. However, these methods have their limitations due to the requirement of sufficient prior knowledge and massive label-classified data. Moreover, it is challenging to obtain the samples of attack behaviors, and the attack behaviors may change frequently to evade detection. In contrast, the normal behaviors are relatively stable except for the update of network services. We propose a dynamic access control model, ABAC-IntroVAE, to address the above issues. ABAC-IntroVAE judges users' requests through rule matching and behavior analysis based on the attributes of the requests. It first filters out requests against the rules by rule matching. Then, the introspective variational autoencoder (IntroVAE) is used for behavior analysis to realize dynamic access decisions. Requests classified as normal can be authorized for access. ABAC-IntroVAE only needs samples of normal requests for training, avoiding the difficult task of collecting massive and frequently changing samples of attack requests. Meanwhile, the IntroVAE model is updated through continual learning to adapt to new-style normal behaviors due to the update of network services. Our experiment study suggests that our proposed ABAC-IntroVAE can effectively perform dynamic access control. It achieves an accuracy of 97.2% in abnormal detection and maintains an accuracy of over 97% through continual learning, despite the addition of new-style user behavior patterns.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:35:01","2023-09-19 10:35:01","","1379-1384","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The health data is subsequently made available to various IoTEHS stakeholders (such as doctors, nurses and patients) to track and monitor patients under observation. However, the entire IoTEHS stakeholders communicate with each other over a wireless unsecured public communication channel. This is a major security and privacy loophole wherein the attacker can exploit the vulnerability of the system and can launch various attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, a secure data dissemination scheme using AI and blockchain is proposed. In this scheme, the transaction collected through healthcare sensors installed around the patients premises act as data sets that is forwarded to the nearby edge devices. The collected data is first filtered using AI-based intrusion detection system located at the edge of the network. Second, a secure health monitoring network is designed using blockchain. Specifically, the filtered or normal transactions are transmitted to centralized cloud servers where the smart contact-enabled consensus mechanism is used to validate the transactions. Once the transaction gets validated, it is stored on distributed InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) of cloud and returned transaction hash is stored on the blockchain ledger located at edge devices making data exchange faster. The detailed experimental investigation demonstrates that the proposed schemes are efficient (in terms of computing and processing time) as well as its resistance to a variety of security attacks.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:35:03","2023-09-19 10:35:03","","1397-1403","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic situation has boosted the upward trend of the popularity of smart medical devices in the healthcare system. Simultaneously, different device manufacturers and technologies compete for a share in a smart medical device's market, which forces the integration of diverse smart medical de-vices into a common healthcare ecosystem. Hence, modern unified healthcare communication systems (UHCSs) combine ISO/IEEE 11073 and Health Level Seven (HL7) communication standards to support smart medical devices' interoperability and their communication with healthcare providers. Despite their advantages in supporting various smart medical devices and communication technologies, these standards do not provide any security and suffer from vulnerabilities. Existing studies provide stand-alone security solutions to components of UHCSs and do not cover UHCSs holistically. In this paper, we perform a systematic threat analysis of UHCSs that relies on attack-defense tree (ADTree) formalisms. Considering the attack landscape and defense ecosys-tem, we build an ADTree for UHCSs and convert the ADTree to stochastic timed automata (STA) to perform quantitative analysis. Our analysis using UPPAAL SMC shows that the Man-in-the-Middle and unauthorized remote access attacks are the most probable attacks that a malicious entity could pursue, causing mistreatment to patients. We also extract valuable information about the top threats, the likelihood of performing different individual and simultaneous attacks, and the expected cost for attackers.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:35:03","2023-09-19 10:35:03","","1404-1410","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the UAVs are deployed in the healthcare system to support the Internet of medical things (IoMT) devices in data collection, medical equipment distribution, and providing smart services.

Inaccurate CSI can deteriorate the performance, particularly of a massive multiple-input multiple-output system. This paper adapts machine learning for CSI prediction. Specifically, we exploit time-series models of deep learning (DL) such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and bidirectional long-short term memory. Further, we use NeuralProphet (NP), a recently introduced time-series model, composed of statistical components, e.g., autoregressive and Fourier terms, for CSI prediction. Inspired by statistical models, we also develop a novel hybrid framework comprising RNN and NP to achieve better prediction accuracy.

Traditional slope-intercept models fall short in capturing large site-specific variations due to urban clutter, terrain tilt or foliage, and ray-tracing faces challenges in characterizing mmWave propagation accurately with reasonable complexity. In this work, we apply machine learning (ML) techniques to predict mmWave path loss on a link-to-link basis over an extensive set of 28 GHz field measurements collected in a major city of USA, with over 120,000 links from both urban and suburban scenarios, with over 40 dB variation for links at similar distances.

Compared to the existing ML-based designs, the proposed IBNet can systematically seek for the optimal balance between the channel estimation accuracy and feedback overhead. To auto-matically learn the feedback compression, a sparsity inducing prior is utilized to sparsify the feature vector, thereby reducing the feedback overhead significantly.

While relaxing this assumption that anyway does not hold in reality due to the heterogeneous nature of devices, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving solution to train a collaborative model over non-iid data distributed across a massive number of devices. However, the appearance of malicious devices (attackers), who intend to corrupt the FL model, is inevitable due to unrestricted participation. In this work, we aim to identify such attackers and mitigate their impact on the model, essentially under a setting of bidirectional label flipping attacks with collusion. We propose two graph theoretic algorithms, based on Minimum Spanning Tree and k-Densest graph, by leveraging correlations between local models. Our FL model can nullify the influence of attackers even when they are up to 70% of all the clients whereas prior works could not afford more than 50% of clients as attackers. The effectiveness of our algorithms is ascertained through experiments on two benchmark datasets, namely MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, with overwhelming attackers.

It evenly distributes the coding rate to every image patch leading to an evident degradation of the overall coding efficiency. To break this fundamental limit, we propose a novel end-to-end wireless image transmission scheme in this paper.

In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based countermeasure approach to safeguard the DNN-based AMC systems against adversarial attack examples. GAN-based aims to eliminate the adversarial attack examples before feeding to the DNN-based classifier. Specifically, we have shown the resiliency of our proposed defense GAN against the Fast-Gradient Sign method (FGSM) algorithm as one of the most potent kinds of attack algorithms to craft the perturbed signals. The existing defense-GAN has been designed for image classification and does not work in our case where the above-mentioned communication system is considered. Thus, our proposed countermeasure approach deploys GANs with a mixture of generators to overcome the mode collapsing problem in a typical GAN facing radio signal classification problem.

The objective is to devise a joint measurement and decision strategy that returns a correct decision (e.g., the least loaded slice) with a certain level of confidence while minimizing the measurement cost (the number of measurements made before committing to the decision). We study the design of such strategies for several natural admission criteria specifying what a correct decision is. For each of these criteria, using tools from best arm identification in bandits, we first derive an explicit information-theoretical lower bound on the cost of any algorithm returning the correct decision with fixed confidence. We then devise a joint measurement and decision strategy achieving this theoretical limit. We compare empirically the measurement costs of these strategies, and compare them both to the lower bounds as well as a naive measurement scheme.

In this work, we implemented a communication channel for the agents to share their information in order to reduce the packet drop rate. For efficient information sharing we use an attention-based communication model, called ATVC, to select informative messages from other agents. The agents then infer the state of queues using a combination of the variational autoencoder, VAE, and product-of-experts, PoE, model. Ultimately, the agents learn what they need to communicate and with whom, instead of communicating all the time with everyone.

This paper studies a learning automata (LA)-based traffic signal control scheme that adapts to real-time traffic patterns and optimizes traffic flows by dynamically changing the green split timings. A novel LA algorithm, called K-Neighbor Multi-Agent Learning Automata (KN-MALA), is proposed to learn the optimal decision online and adjust the traffic light accordingly in an attempt to minimize the overall waiting time at an intersection. In particular, KN-MALA employs an online distributed learning framework that integrates the traffic condition of neighboring intersections to efficiently learn and infer optimal decisions for large-scale traffic signal systems.

We utilize a hybrid multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (hMA-DRL) framework to maximize the connectivity and enhance the number of successful decoded users at the BS. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves a solution near to the optimal one and increases the successful decoded users by 42.38% as compared to the benchmark scheme.

Recently, beam training based on codebook selection has been proposed as a low-latency means for tuning the RIS phase profile according to a desired performance metric. However, it requires the transmission of reference signals to measure the performance with different RIS phase configurations available in the codebook, which reduces the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider the uplink of a Multiple-Input Signal-Output (MISO) communication system with Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and present a novel scheme for simultaneous RIS phase configuration and data transmission. The proposed scheme is based on non-coherent differential modulation, which is deployed both in the beam training and the data transmission phases. In the former phase, it also enables energy measurement for the determination of the best RIS phase profile. Then, in the latter phase, a higher throughput can be established through the high gain reflective link.

We analyze the power scaling law for optical IRSs and unveil its dependence on the wavelength, transmitter (Tx)-to-IRS and IRS-to-receiver (Rx) distances, beam waist, and lens size. We compare optical IRSs in different power scaling regimes with optical relays in terms of the outage probability, diversity and coding gains, and optimal placement. Our results show that, at the expense of a higher hardware complexity, relay-assisted FSO links yield a better outage performance at high signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs), but optical IRSs can achieve a higher performance at low SNRs.

When performing a multicast on the constellation, the changing of serving satellites leads to many link handover control messages. To minimize the control message overhead is NP-hard. Therefore, a dynamic programming-based algorithm called Dynamic Multicast Tree Selection (DMTS) is proposed to find the sub-optimal result with polynomial time complexity.

Traditional Mobile IP protocol can solve the problem by using the home agent and the tunneling mechanism. However, for space-terrestrial integrated networks, Mobile IP is inefficient as it introduces (1) increased latency when registering with the remote home agent, (2) high packet loss due to large registration latency, (3) triangular routing to the remote home agent.

Specifically, (1) we divide the Earth's surface into partitions and maintain a partition-satellite mapping table in real-time according to the regularity of satellite motion, (2) we always route traffic to the satellite above the destined terminal by querying the partition-satellite mapping table, which eliminates triangular routing and the related performance overheads, (3) we handle the corner case that multiple satellites occur above the destined terminal by proposing last-hop relay.

For solving localization problems, a simplified, stationary, narrowband far-field channel model is widely used due to its compact formulation. However, with increased array size in extra-large multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems and increased bandwidth at upper mmWave bands, the effect of channel spatial non-stationarity (SNS), spherical wave model (SWM), and beam squint effect (BSE) cannot be ignored. In this case, localization performance will be affected when an inaccurate channel model deviating from the true model is adopted. In this work, we employ the misspecified Cramer-Rao lower bound to lower bound the localization error using a simplified mismatched model while the observed data is governed by a more complex true model. The simulation results show that among all the model impairments, the SNS has the least contribution, the SWM dominates when the distance is small compared to the array size, and the BSE has a more significant effect when the distance is much larger than the array size.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:35:18","2023-09-19 10:35:18","","1588-1593","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To tackle this issue, we design a novel referential AMP detector composed by hierarchically cascading many small LUTs, where only informative integer-valued messages are exchanged on a factor graph. The quantization thresholds of LUTs are sequentially computed by tracking the discrete distribution of the LUT outputs at each layer to minimize the performance degradation owing to quantization errors. Based on the distribution at each layer, the thresholds are optimized by clustering with the Lloyd-Max algorithm using the initial values given by the k-means++ method. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of the bit error rate (BER) performance and memory usage.

However, due to the “multiplicative fading” effect, the existing passive RISs only achieve a negligible capacity gain in environments with strong direct links. In this paper, the concept of active RISs is studied to overcome this fundamental limitation. Unlike the existing passive RISs that reflect signals without amplification, active RISs can amplify the reflected signals via amplifiers integrated into their elements. To characterize the signal amplification and incorporate the noise introduced by the active components, we verify the signal model of active RISs through the experimental measurements on a fabricated active RIS element. Based on the verified signal model, we formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for an active RIS aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system and a joint transmit precoding and reflect beamforming algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results show that, in a typical wireless system, the existing passive RISs can realize only a negligible sum-rate gain of 3%, while the active RISs can achieve a significant sum-rate gain of 62%, thus over coming the “multiplicative fading” effect.

While the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique has been widely adopted to support high-quality communications, it also has great potentials of improving radar sensing performance and providing flexible S&C. In this paper, we propose to jointly design the dual-functional transmit signals occupying several subcarriers to realize multi-user OFDM communications and detect one moving target in the presence of clutter.

To construct the TQAM-structured joint constellations, the strong user employs a rectangular QAM, while the weak user adopts a TQAM. We derive closed-form expressions for the entire 22m + 22n super-imposed constellation cases with both users adopt constellations with even-power-of-two points. Construction algorithms for both the strong user and the weak user have been provided. Closed-form expressions for the MD are also derived, and the MD analysis shows that the proposed TQAM-structured constellation always attains larger MDs among the existing schemes for NOMA constellation design.

This square-root implementation is shown to be numerically stable when inverting the covariance matrix, as it always assures the covariance matrix to be symmetric and positive semi-definite. In the paper we also analyze the computational complexity and cost with different combining methods. We show that the Kalman filter implementation provides the same result as the MMSE method in terms of the spectral efficiencies and equivalent SINR. However, the Kalman filter implementation is shown to be very efficient as it provides the possibility to fully utilize parallel computing of distributed hardware processors. Moreover, the processing can be decentralized and the estimates can be aggregated from local estimates to as many access points (APs) as needed to reach the desired performance target. A Kalman filter implementation has the flexibility to aggregate signals in different ways, allowing the fronthaul architecture to support connectivity of individual APs in any combination of parallel or serial manners.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:35:31","2023-09-19 10:35:31","","1703-1708","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the traditional beamforming scheme for AoSA, i.e., each subarray serves an exclusive user, cannot cope with the effect of beam split in THz wideband communications. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, i.e., beam split aggregation and multiplexing (BSAM), to support wideband THz communication with AoSA architecture. Specifically, we first characterize the direction of beam split and then derive the maximum bandwidth of a subband that will not cause beam split.

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology enhances the performance of SWIPT systems via precoding. We typically rely on heuristic precoding designs in practice, due to their favorable performance-complexity balance, as opposed to their optimization-based counterparts. On the other hand, these designs provide limited flexibility. Furthermore, the standard precoding heuristics are SWIPT-agnostic. In this paper, we propose a novel MIMO precoding framework for SWIPT that is based on the notion of controllable residual interference to resolve the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we consider a multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast system for SWIPT with separate energy and information receivers. In this context, we formulate interference-constrained problems and apply a relaxation to obtain low-complexity solutions that admit closed-form expressions. We also extend our approach to hybrid precoding designs for the case where the base station adopts an analog/digital architecture due to particularly stringent cost and energy consumption constraints. Numerical simulations unveil the performance gains of the proposed precoding schemes over the solutions based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and heuristic baseline methods and provide valuable insights.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:35:32","2023-09-19 10:35:32","","1715-1720","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose an augmented deep unfolding (ADU) approach that jointly optimizes the beamforming scheme at the BSs and the channel quantization scheme at the users. In particular, the classic WMMSE beamformer is unrolled and a deep neural network (DNN) is leveraged to preprocess its input to enhance the performance.

This paper investigates the potential of HAPS offloading to reduce the energy demand from the grid and the operational cost of mobile networks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of HAPS offloading in reducing the size of the RE supply that is required to achieve grid energy reduction on the terrestrial network, thus enhancing the feasibility of a sustainable evolution towards 6G networks.

In this paper, we propose a Dinkelbach-guided deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme for secure communication in the UAV-aided MEC network. Specifically, the security calculating efficiency of the network is maximized by optimizing offloading decision and resource allocation under the condition of the data queue stability and minimum calculating requirement. The problem is intractable due to the fractional structure and binary constraint. Firstly, we deal with the fractional structure by taking advantage of Dinkelbach optimization.

In this study, we successfully applied the XGBoost Algorithm (Supervised Machine Learning) to classify the type of the virus using the SERS sensor data. The supervised approach has a limitation when a new type of virus arises, whose shape is different from the previously known samples. To tackle this problem, we investigated the unsupervised learning approaches that can cluster the virus data into different groups without labeled data. The unsupervised approach presented in this paper is called k-Shape Clustering. This technique compares the cross-correlation between different samples and then clusters them into similar or different groups. If a subvariant of a virus emerges, it would be clustered into the existing virus groups; if a new type of virus is found, it would be clustered into a new group.

To tackle those challenges, we propose a novel adaptive equalization scheme, which exploits the prosperous advances in deep learning by training an equalizer with an adversarial network. The learning is only based on the statistics of the transmit signal, so it is blind regarding the actual transmit symbols and agnostic to the channel model. The proposed approach is independent of the equalizer topology and enables the application of powerful neural network based equalizers.

Thus, packets transmissions are prone to delay due to the LBT channel access mechanism. How to achieve Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) requirements in NR-U networks under the coexistence with WiFi networks is of importance and extremely challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the downlink URLLC trans-mission in the NR-U and WiFi coexistence system through dynamically adjusting the energy detection (ED) thresholds. Our results have shown that the NR-U system reliability has been improved significantly via the DRL compared to that without learning approaches, but with the sacrifice of WiFi system reliability.

Conventional FL policies require a central coordinator, namely a Parameter Server (PS), to orchestrate the learning process which limits the scalability and robustness of the training platform. Consensus-driven FL methods, on the other hand, enable fully decentralized learning implementations where vehicles mutually share the Machine Learning (ML) model parameters, possibly via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networking, at the expense of larger communication resource consumption compared to vanilla FL approaches. This paper proposes a communication-efficient consensus-driven FL design tailored for the training of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in vehicular networks. The vehicles taking part in the FL process independently select a pre-determined percentage of model parameters to be quantized and exchanged on each training round. The proposed technique is validated on a cooperative sensing use case where vehicles rely on Lidar point clouds to detect possible road objects/users in their surroundings via DNN. The validation considers latency, accuracy and communication efficiency trade-offs.

The standard one-shot, or embarrassingly parallel, Bayesian learning protocol known as consensus Monte Carlo (CMC) is generalized by proposing two straggler-resilient solutions based on grouping and coding. Two main challenges in designing straggler-resilient algorithms for CMC are the need to estimate the statistics of the workers' outputs across multiple shots, and the joint non-linear post-processing of the outputs of the workers carried out at the server. This is in stark contrast to other distributed settings like gradient coding, which only require the per-shot sum of the workers' outputs. The proposed methods, referred to as Group-based CMC (G-CMC) and Coded CMC (C-CMC), leverage redundant computing at the workers in order to enable the estimation of global posterior samples at the server based on partial outputs from the workers. Simulation results show that C-CMC may outperform G-CMC for a small number of workers, while G-CMC is generally preferable for a larger number of workers.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:35:59","2023-09-19 10:35:59","","609-614","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In most of the literature, a dedicated neural network is trained for each specific optimization problem. However, under many scenarios, several distinct objectives are worth optimizing on the same wireless environment. Instead of exhaustively training a new model for every objective, it is more efficient to exploit the correlations between these objectives to train models with shared model parameters and feature representations. In the deep learning literature, transfer learning has been proposed to encourage knowledge transfer among models solving correlated problems. Unlike a majority of transfer learning applications where the high level features are relatively easy to locate in the neural networks, this paper considers wireless communication problems, in which it is much more difficult to identify high level features transferable to correlated tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes to add an additional reconstruction loss when training the model. This new loss is for reconstructing the problem inputs starting from a selected neural network hidden layer. This approach encourages the features learnt to be general and descriptive about the inputs, instead of being solely responsible for minimizing the specific task-based loss. When a new objective is to be optimized, these features can be readily used for transfer learning. Simulation results in device-to-device wireless network power allocation optimization suggest that the proposed approach is highly efficient in data and model complexity, resilient to over-fitting, and supports competitive optimization performances.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:35:59","2023-09-19 10:35:59","","615-620","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, some applications (e.g., training a reinforcement learning algorithm to operate in highly reliable systems or rare event simulations) require access to a broad range of observed failures and extreme values, preferably in a short time. In this paper, we propose IL-GAN, an alternative training framework for generative adversarial networks (GANs), which leverages incremental learning (IL) to enable the generation to learn the tail behavior of the distribution using only a few samples. We validate the proposed IL-GAN with data from 5G simulations on a factory automation scenario and real measurements gathered from various video streaming platforms.

To ease these challenges, frequent communications between user equipments (UEs) and the cen-tral macro base station (MBS) are necessary, aggravating the communication burden. In this paper, a novel hierarchical FL framework is proposed to alleviate the biased convergence of the global model, achieving better communication and computation efficiency. Specifically, the UEs are adaptively clustered and allocated to specific small base stations (SBSs) according to channel conditions, geographic locations, and data distributions. The SBSs are further aggregated to the MBS, forming a hier-archical FL framework. The joint user clustering and wireless resource allocation optimization problem is formulated. To solve this problem, a cross entropy (CE) based method with low computational complexity is proposed.

In this paper, we consider a multi-user system where an RRS is employed as the transmit antenna array at the base station (BS). To avoid the high overhead of acquiring perfect channel state information (CSI), a codebook and beam training mechanism is required to develop the beamforming scheme. Given the large physical dimension of the RRS, users are likely to distribute in both the near field and the far field of the BS, making the codebook design more difficult. To address this issue, we design a hybrid near-far field codebook which applies to all users in any location with low overhead. To further reduce the training overhead, each codeword is designed to cover multiple spatial areas, enabling a multi-user beam training mechanism which can be performed for all users simultaneously. Under a general setting including both the near-field and far-field users, simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the overhead and achieves a higher sum rate compared to the state-of-the-art codebooks, which performs very close to that of the perfect CSI case.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:02","2023-09-19 10:36:02","","639-644","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with the phased array, reconfigurable refractive surface (RRS), which is free of phase shifters, can significantly improve the system capacity given the same power budget. In this paper, we consider a multi-user RRS-based HMIMO system.

Therefore, the far-field approximation no longer holds, urging a new performance analysis framework.

This model is employed in the optimization problem to analyze the practical system performance. RISs are able to establish artificial and enhanced radio links among network nodes, while the low-rank property of the base station (BS)-RIS channel restricts the spatial multiplexing gain. By balancing among the data streams in terms of reducing the condition number of the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel matrix, the multiplexing gain can also be improved. Different criteria, including the condition number, the minimum singular value, the effective rank and capacity, are exploited to identify an optimized RIS reflection coefficient matrix to obtain higher spatial multiplexing gain.

In massive MIMO applications, the overhead of channel state information (CSI) exchange among distributed transmitters is too large to make it possible in practical implementations. In this paper, we consider a cooperative multicell massive MIMO network with distributed regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding at each base station (BS), where a novel CSI exchange scheme is devised to reduce the interactive overhead. As a key finding of this work, we theoretically prove that it suffices to share the Gram matrix of local CSI among the cooperative BSs in order to achieve the same performance as a centralized cooperative MIMO network using the RZF precoding with global CSI sharing. The CSI exchange from each BS is thus reduced to a symmetric matrix that has a much smaller size than the full CSI and the amount of CSI exchange does NOT grow with the large number of antennas in massive MIMO. Specifically, based on the exchanged Gram matrices, we derive a decentralized RZF precoding design at each BS and develop both the optimal and suboptimal cooperative power allocation strategies, which achieve different performance and complexity tradeoffs. A virtual centralized power allocation is accomplished at each BS and the performance achieved by the proposed decentralized precoding is the same as the centralized benchmark scheme with full CSI exchange. These superiorities of the proposed schemes are verified through simulation results.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:06","2023-09-19 10:36:06","","699-704","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, estimating the cascaded channels between the user equipment (UE) through the IRS to the base station (BS) is a major bottleneck in IRS-assisted systems. In this work, we present a novel method to estimate all the cascaded IRS channels in a multiple-IRS (called as distributed IRS in this paper) aided mmWave massive MIMO system. We exploit the inherent structure in mmWave channels to reformulate the channel estimation problem as one of direction of arrival (DoA) and departure (DoD) estimation in the cascaded channel. In turn, this allows us to use subspace based methods from array processing to develop a joint ESPRIT-MUSIC algorithm for estimating the DoA at the BS and the DoD from the UE. An attractive feature of the scheme is its low pilot overhead requirement: unlike existing methods, the number of pilot symbols does not scale with number of IRS elements or the number of antennas at the BS; it only depends on the number of IRSs deployed and the number of antennas at the UE. We compare our method against state-of-the-art methods, and numerically illustrate its superior performance and robustness to the number of IRSs in the system.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:07","2023-09-19 10:36:07","","717-723","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve high-accuracy delay estimation, a number of multiband-based algorithms have been proposed recently, which exploit the channel state information (CSI) measurements over multiple non-contiguous frequency bands. However, to our best knowledge, there still lacks an efficient scheme that fully exploits the multiband gains when phase distortion factors are considered, due to that the associated multi-parameter estimation problem contains many local optimums and the existing algorithms can easily get stuck in a “bad” local optimum. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage global estimation (TSGE) scheme for multiband delay estimation. In the coarse stage, we propose a weighted multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm to achieve an initial delay estimation based on a coarse signal model. The estimation problem derived from the coarse signal model contains less local optimums and thus a more stable estimation can be achieved than directly using the original signal model. Then in the refined stage, with the help of coarse estimation results to narrow down the search range, we perform a global delay estimation using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on a refined multiband signal model to exploit the multiband gains to further improve the estimation accuracy.

Specifically, each vehicle enables the base station (BS)/access point (AP) to separate different channel state information (CSI) by inserting orthogonal sequences into the sending data. The BS adopts deep learning to filter the noise and predict the beamforming weight to achieve phase synchronization. Unlike traditional distributed uplink beamforming, ArguteDUB can be adapted to the highly dynamic time-varying channels. The simple network structure ensures the fast response of ArguteDUB. In addition, we make ArguteDUB Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) compatible so that it can be easily deployed in 6G networks.

However in the centralized architecture, designing the precoder and cluster at central processing unit (CPU) with considering all RF chains of all APs together, the AP-wise clustering could not fit well especially when a large number of UEs are multiplexed. Because the RF chains with high coupling loss (the sum of the path loss and BF gain of the analog beam) could be included in the APs of the cluster to each UE.

We then formulate a mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem to tune the UAV trajectory and the global aggregation coefficients based on the analysis results. An algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed to solve the formulated problem. Simulation results demonstrate the great potential of our UAV-assisted hierarchical aggregation scheme.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:12","2023-09-19 10:36:12","","807-812","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An established way to map uniform binary sources to non-uniform symbol distributions is to assign a different number of bits to different constellation points. Doing so, however, means that erroneous demodulation at the receiver can lead to bit insertions or deletions that result in significant binary error propagation. In this paper, we introduce a light-weight variant of Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) to resolve insertion and deletion errors at the receiver by using a simple padding scheme. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our approach results in an overall gain in demodulated bit-error-rate of over 2 dB Eb/NO when compared to 128-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). The GRAND-aided OM scheme outperforms coding with a low-density parity check code of the same average rate as that induced by our simple padding.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:13","2023-09-19 10:36:13","","813-818","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nonlinear optoacoustic signal generated by proper laser parameters can propagate long distances in water. However, forming such a signal requires a high-power laser, and the buildup of a vapor cloud precludes the subsequent acoustic signal generation. Therefore, pursuing the traditional on-off keying (OOK) modulation technique will limit the data rate and power efficiency. In this paper, we analyze different modulation techniques and propose a vapor cloud delayed-differential pulse position modulation (VCD-DPPM) technique to improve the data rate and achieve high power efficiency for a single stationary laser transmitter. The symbol rate of VCD-DPPM is approximately 6.9 times and 1.69 times higher than OOK in our text communication simulation using a laser repetition rate of 10 kHz and 40 Hz, respectively. Furthermore, VCD-DPPM is 137% more power efficient than the OOK technique for both cases. We have generated different acoustic signal levels in laboratory conditions and simulated the bit error rate (BER) for different depths and positions of the UWN, while considering ambient underwater noises. Our results indicate that VCD-DPPM enables efficient data transmission.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:13","2023-09-19 10:36:13","","819-824","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compare the proposed network to another neural network-based technique for metric calculation, the ViterbiNet, which was originally designed for ISI channels. The simulation results confirm that the proposed neural network outperforms the ViterbiNet, with much lower complexity, and is much more resilient to channel uncertainty than the traditional Viterbi detector, which uses Euclidean distance for metric calculations. We further show that the proposed neural network exhibits robustness to being trained at mismatched SNR values and FTN squeezing parameters, meaning that the number of trained models required can be significantly reduced. Additionally, the results show that the proposed neural network remains a favorable alternative at much higher levels of channel uncertainties, the results also reflect that we can generalize the proposed network to work with different channel models defined by different decaying factors.

For several decades, user authentication was based on the “something the user knows”, known also as knowledge-based user authentication. Recent studies state that although knowledge-based user authentication has been the most popular for authenticating an individual, nowadays it is no more considered secure and convenient for the mobile user as it is imposing several limitations. These limitations stress the need for the development and implementation of more secure and usable user authentication methods. Toward this direction, user authentication based on the “something the user is” has caught the attention. This category includes authentication methods which make use of human physical characteristics (also referred to as physiological biometrics), or involuntary actions (also referred to as behavioral biometrics). In particular, risk-based user authentication based on behavioral biometrics appears to have the potential to increase mobile authentication security without sacrificing usability. In this context, we, firstly, present an overview of user authentication on mobile devices and discuss risk-based user authentication for mobile devices as a suitable approach to deal with the security vs. usability challenge. Afterwards, a set of novelty detection algorithms for risk estimation is tested and evaluated to identify the most appropriate ones for risk-based user authentication on mobile devices.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:14","2023-09-19 10:36:14","","837-842","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to cope with these issues, in this article, 6G and blockchain technology are considered to improve network performance and ensure the authenticity of data sharing for the MEC-enabled IoT. Meanwhile, a novel intelligent optimization method named as collective reinforcement learning (CRL) is proposed and introduced, to realize intelligent resource allocation, meet distributed training results sharing and avoid excessive consumption of system resources. Based on the designed network model, a cloud-edge collaborative resource allocation framework is formulated. By joint optimizing the offloading decision, block interval and transmission power, it aims to minimize the consumption overheads of system energy and service latency.

Further, an attention-based graph convolutional neural network is utilized to capture the structural identity associated with the attack path. It is important to note that when inferring whether a specific system node is malicious or not, our approach optimizes the provenance subgraph generated for that node without destroying its contextual semantics. The discovered attack nodes are correlated chronologically for attack investigation and scenario reconstruction. Our approach is evaluated on a real-world Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) dataset.

However, such a distributed algorithm is vulnerable to sensitive information leakage when an attacker intercepts the transport decisions communicated between nodes during the distributed ADMM updates. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving distributed mechanism based on output variable perturbation by adding appropriate randomness to each node's decision before it is shared with other corresponding nodes at each update instance.

It allows the allocation of a dedicated logical network slice of the physical network to each application. Security is one of the paramount challenges in an NS ecosystem. Several technologies, including Machine Learning (ML), have been proposed to mitigate security challenges in 5G networks. However, the use of ML for NS security is not properly implemented. Especially, the scarcity of coordination and the difficulties of privacy-protected information sharing between slices cause failures and performance degradation of these ML based NS security solutions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Federated Learning (FL) based coordinated security orchestration architecture named Federated Learning enabled Security Orchestrator (FLeSO) to centrally perform security operations in a slicing ecosystem while preserving the privacy of the data. In addition, the proposed FLeSO architecture enables features such as proactive security deployment and steady security level maintenance independent of the slicing strategy. The proposed architecture is implemented in a real-world slicing testbed, and a comprehensive set of experiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed FLeSO architecture. The test results illustrate the significant advantage of the proposed approach over the legacy system in terms of improving the security of an NS ecosystem.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:20","2023-09-19 10:36:20","","915-920","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the user data can still be inferred via the shared model updates. To strengthen the privacy, we consider FL with local differential privacy (LDP). One of the challenges in FL is its huge communication cost caused by iterative transmissions of model updates. It has been relieved by quantization in the literature, however, there have been not many works that consider its effect on LDP and the unboundedness of the randomized model updates. We propose a communication-efficient FL algorithm with LDP that uses a Gaussian mechanism followed by quantization and the Elias-gamma coding. A novel design of the algorithm guarantees LDP even after the quantization. Under the proposed algorithm, we provide a trade-off analysis of privacy and communication costs theoretically: quantization reduces the communication costs but requires a larger perturbation to enable LDP. Experimental results show that the accuracy is mostly affected by the noise from LDP mechanisms, and it becomes enhanced when the quantization error is larger. Nonetheless, our experimental results enabled LDP with a significant compression ratio and only a slight reduction of accuracy in return. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm outperforms another algorithm with a discrete Gaussian mechanism under the same privacy budget and communication costs constraints in the experiments.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:20","2023-09-19 10:36:20","","921-926","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lack of centralized supervision requires all kinds of system nodes to voluntarily participate while their behaviors are profit-driven and unpredictable, thus introducing challenges to system performance. Moreover, the nodes in a decentralized crowdsourcing system inherently observe little information about the system status; therefore, it is difficult for them to discover and adopt theoretically optimal strategies. Current literature still lacks an effective mechanism to motivate the participation of all types of nodes. To this end, this paper employs a two-layer game model to simulate the interactions in the decentralized crowdsourcing system for investigating the participation willingness of different system nodes. Specifically, we apply a Stackelberg game to model the interactions of a crowdsourcing requester and other nodes, where the requester decides its reward policy and the others respond by selecting their roles to play. In addition, the interaction of the bounded rational other nodes is further represented as an evolutionary game. After analyzing the game model, we further design an incentive mechanism to maximize the requester utility while motivating other nodes to actively participate in the crowdsourcing. Through experimental simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:20","2023-09-19 10:36:20","","927-933","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among others, these technologies comprise Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRSs) and Mobile Relays (MRs), whose envisaged roles include mitigating the negative effects of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) connectivity, in particular at mm Wave and higher frequencies. The core idea behind these technologies is to use cooperative networking where the source sends a signal to a repeater, in this case the IRS or the MR, which is upon reception forwarded to the destination. When comparing the two technologies, it is important to realize that the IRSs are primarily envisioned to be static entities attached to various objects in the environment such as walls and furniture. In contrast, the MRs will feature a higher degree of freedom, as they will be able to position themselves seamlessly in the environment. Based on the above assumptions, we derive an approach for determining the optimal position of the IRS and MR in indoor environments, i.e., the one that maximizes the end-to-end link quality between the source and the destination. We follow by capturing the communication quality indicators for both IRS- and MR-supported NLoS avoidance in indoor mm Wave communication in a number of scenarios.

Accounting to the potential unreliable wireless channels due to the impurities of the propagation environments, such as deep fading, blockages, etc., multiple RISs are deployed in the considered IoT network to mitigate the propagation-induced impairments, to enhance the quality of the wireless links, and to ensure that the required freshness of information is achieved. In this setup, an optimization problem has been formulated to minimize the average sum Age of Information (AoI) by optimizing the transmit power of the IoTDs, the IoTDs clustering policy, and the RISs configurations. The formulated problem ends up to be a mixed-integer non-convex problem. In order to tackle this challenge, the RISs configurations are first obtained by adopting a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach. Then, the joint power allocation and user-clustering problem is solved using the concept of bi-level optimization, where the original problem is decomposed into an outer IoTDs clustering problem and an inner power allocation problem. Optimal closed-form expressions are derived for the inner problem and the Hungarian method is invoked to solve the outer problem.

The existing solutions are either not compatible with the LTE/NR standards or not flexible enough for complex and dynamic IIoT environments. In this paper, we propose a policy learning based unlicensed communication (PLUC) framework to directly learn coexistence policies from the spectrogram of frequency channels. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is built to deal with the observations from time-variant spectrogram and extract deep learning features. We further verify this framework under the duty cycle mechanism and the listen before talk mechanism in 3GPP standards, respectively. The experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the dynamic environment.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:26","2023-09-19 10:36:26","","1013-1018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multi-agent RL, which allows separate local execution of policy, has been applied to large-scale wireless communication areas. However, it has performance issue which largely varies with different system settings. In this paper, we study a multi-agent algorithm for a coordinate multipoint (CoMP) scenario, which requires cooperation between base stations. We show that the common settings of user distribution, the design of reward, and episodic in the environment can significantly ease the learning of the algorithm and obtain beautiful converge results. However, these settings are not realistic in wireless communication. By validating the performance difference between these settings with our algorithm in a coordinate multipoint (CoMP) scenario, we introduce several possible solutions and highlight the necessity of further study in this area.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:26","2023-09-19 10:36:26","","1019-1024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The IIoT device generates computing tasks, such as object recognition, to be processed by DNN. For each task, a local controller at the network edge determines whether or not to offload the task to the edge server before it enters each layer of the lightweight DNN. The objective is to find the task offloading point that maximizes a utility including delay, inference accuracy, and on-device energy consumption. To achieve this objective, we propose an online DT-assisted task offloading scheme, which exploits DTs to capture the task processing status at the IIoT device and the workload at the edge server.

To achieve this vision, ZSM calls for a large usage of advanced deep learning algorithms, in order to dynamically build efficient decisions. In this context, Federated deep Learning (FL) proved their efficiency in not only building collaborative deep learning models, among several network slices, but also ensuring the privacy and isolation of such network slices. Indeed, FL-based solutions give “machine-centric” decisions about running network slices and their performance, which will be then executed/applied by managers, i.e., slice manager staff/module. However, FL-enabled solutions do not provide any details about why and how such decisions were made, and thus such decisions cannot be properly trusted/understood by slice managers. To alleviate this issue, we leverage eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) paradigm that aims to improve the transparency of black-box FL decision-making process. In particular, XAI helps to explain the FL-based decisions to make them interpretable/trustable by network slices managers. In this paper, we design a novel XAI-powered framework to explain FL-based decisions. We first build a deep learning model in federated way, to predict key performance indicators (KPI) of network slices. Our FL-based KPI prediction is useful for the configuration and the management of network slice lifecycle, especially for the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and the network slice re-configuration. Then, we develop several XAI models on the top of our FL-based model, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), RuleFit, and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP), to enhance the level of trust, credibility (of the local data/model), transparency, and explanation of the FL-based decisions, while adhering the data privacy, to different B5G network stakeholders, such as slice managers.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Deep Learning framework for proactive content caching that models the dynamic interaction between users and content items, particularly their features. The proposed model performs the caching task by building a probability distribution across different content items, per user, via a Deep Neural Network model and supports, both, centralized and distributed caching schemes. In addition, the paper addresses the key question: Do we need an explicit user-item pairs-based recommendation system in content caching? i.e., do we need to develop a recommendation system while tackling the content caching problem? To this end, an end-to-end Deep Learning framework is introduced. Finally, we validate our approach through extensive experiments on a real-world, public data set, coined MovieLens.

Due to the fact that clients of FL frequently have restricted connection bandwidth, it is necessary to optimize the communication between servers and clients. FL clients frequently interact through Wi-Fi and must operate in uncertain network situations. Nevertheless, the enormous number of weights transmitted and received by existing FL aggregation techniques dramatically degrade the accuracy in unstable network situations.

The proposed approach improves the performance under unstable network conditions by transferring score principles rather than all client models' weights. We achieve a 13.55% average improvement in the global model's accuracy while decreasing the data capacity required for network communication.

In the considered model, the one-bit gradient quantization with majority vote is adopted at edge devices, which sends the local gradient sign to the edge server instead of transmitting high-dimensional stochastic gradients directly. After aggregating the quantified signs, the edge server sends back only the majority decision to significantly minimize the transmission overhead since all communications are compressed to one bit. Nevertheless, it turns out that the quality of training will be inevitably deteriorated by the undesirable propagation error introduced by wireless channels. To address this issue, we propose in this work a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted one-bit communication scheme under orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to reduce the signal distortion during iterative model exchange of FEEL. Specifically, a learning convergence analysis with respect to wireless communication error is first established. After that, we further formulate a unified communication-learning design problem to jointly optimize the power allocation vector and the RIS configuration matrix.

We show that the spectral efficiency can increase linearly with the symbol rate while satisfying out- of-band constraint.

Since heat conduction is modelled by a linear partial differential equation, it can be analyzed as a linear system with an input heat source and output temperature distribution. The magnitude of the thermal channel's frequency response is an exponentially decaying function of frequency. The thermal channel's capacity increases when the total power increases, similar to typical communication based on electromagnetic waves. Uniquely however, the thermal channel's effective bandwidth is constrained by the total power since a water-filling algorithm determines a cutoff frequency. Additionally, the quadratic nature of the heat equation presents a novel quadratic scaling of the channel capacity. Scaling space by a factor of 2 and time by 4 improves the channel capacity by a factor of 4. This implies that scaling space down from centimeter to micrometer domain improves the channel capacity by a factor of 108• The thermal channel presents various novel qualities and a possible exciting application for intra-chip communication.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:31","2023-09-19 10:36:31","","1085-1090","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, we propose a cooperative multi-agent proximal optimization algorithm (CMAPPO) to make driving-decision for each CAV agent and achieve collaboration in a distributed manner. Finally, simulations are carried out on SUMO to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the CMAPPO has significant effectiveness in solving the multi-vehicle coordination at intersections.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:33","2023-09-19 10:36:33","","1115-1120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, medical research has proved that ASD affects the facial features of its patients, making the syndrome recognizable from distinctive signs within an individual's face. Given that as a motivation behind our work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving FL model, in order to predict ASD in a certain individual based on their behavioral traits or facial features, while respecting patient data privacy, as ASD data is medical and hence sensitive to leakage. After training behavioral and facial image data on Federated Machine Learning (FL) models, promising results are achieved, with 70% accuracy for prediction of ASD according to behavioral traits in a federated learning private environment, and a 62% accuracy is reached for prediction of ASD given an image of the patient's face.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:33","2023-09-19 10:36:33","","1121-1127","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within the recent COVID-19 pandemic situation, interest in permanent remote health monitoring solutions has raised, targeting to reduce contact and preserve the limited medical resources. Among the technological methods to realize efficient remote health monitoring, federated learning (FL) has drawn particular attention due to its robustness in preserving data privacy. However, FL can yield to high communication costs, due to frequent transmissions between the FL server and clients. To tackle this problem, we propose in this paper a communication-efficient federated learning (CEFL) framework that involves clients clustering and transfer learning. First, we propose to group clients through the calculation of similarity factors, based on the neural networks characteristics. Then, a representative client in each cluster is selected to be the leader of the cluster. Differently from the conventional FL, our method performs FL training only among the cluster leaders. Subsequently, transfer learning is adopted by the leader to update its cluster members with the trained FL model. Finally, each member fine-tunes the received model with its own data. To further reduce the communication costs, we opt for a partial-layer FL aggregation approach. This method suggests partially updating the neural network model rather than fully. Through experiments, we show that CEFL can save up to to 98.45% in communication costs while conceding less than 3% in accuracy loss, when compared to the conventional FL. Finally, CEFL demonstrates a high accuracy for clients with small or unbalanced datasets.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:34","2023-09-19 10:36:34","","1128-1133","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, traditional FL algorithms impose strict requirements on the clients' selection and its ratio. Moreover, the data training becomes inefficient when the client's computational resources are limited. Towards this goal, we aim to extend FL, a decentralized learning framework that efficiently works with heterogeneous clients in practical industrial scenarios. To this end, we propose a Clients' Eligibility Protocol (CEP), a resource-aware FL solution, for a heterogeneous environment. To this end, we use a Trusted Authority (TA) between the clients and the cloud server, which calculates the client's eligibility score based on local computing resources such as bandwidth, memory, and battery life and selects the most resourceful clients for training. If a client gives a slow response or infuses an incorrect model, the TA declares that the client is ineligible for future training. Besides, the proposed CEP leverages the asynchronous FL model, which avoids a long delay in a client's response. The empirical results proves that the proposed CEP gains the benefits of resource-aware clients selection and achieves 88 % and 93 % of accuracy on AlexNet and LeNet, respectively.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:36:35","2023-09-19 10:36:35","","1140-1145","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the UDNs, the number of BSs in 5G networks is proliferating, along with the energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to cut down the energy attrition in 5G networks under the assurance of delay. Till now, some researchers have proved that the association of users and the sleeping states of BSs have a significant effect on energy consumption and latency in 5G networks. However, the traditional solutions associate users and select states nonadaptively without the dual consideration of energy-saving and delay. In view of this, we propose a dual-adaptive delay-aware and energy-saving system (DADEs) in 5G networks. To further optimize the energy and delay of 5G BSs, the model is split into two tandem problems: user association and BS state selection. Meanwhile, a tandem deep reinforcement learning (T-DRL) algorithm is presented to make decisions in these problems for optimizing and balancing performance between delay and energy adaptively. Additionally, the real datasets of 5G users and BSs are used and trained in this paper.

Client selection is critical to determine the performance of FL. Most of the existing client selection methods aim to maximize the number of selected clients, who can upload their local models before the deadline, in each global iteration, thus potentially accelerating the model convergence rate. However, these methods ignore the fact that most of the IoT devices are powered by on-board batteries and harvested green energy from the environment to prolong battery life. Hence, clients selected by these methods may not have sufficient energy to upload their local models in a global iteration or are unable to participate in the training process in the near future due to battery drainage. In this paper, we propose a novel client selection, entitled “EnerGy-AwaRe CliEnt SElection for Green FeDerated Learning (GREED)”, to optimize the trade-off between maximizing the number of selected clients and minimizing the energy drawn from batteries for the selected clients, while ensuring that all the selected clients have sufficient energy to upload their local models before the deadline.

However, most existing research is based on an unclear relation between system throughput and covertness, due to the use of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To solve this problem, in this paper, we explore the exact throughput-covertness relation by investigating the likelihood variation distance. An algorithm is established to find the minimum channel uses required for the transmission of a given amount of information and a certain covertness constraint. The rigorous proof of the convergence of the algorithm is also given. Our results show that an overly strict constraint on covertness would lead to a large sacrifice of system throughput, and it is not cost-effective to increase the number of channel uses to improve covertness if only a small amount of information is to be transmitted.

In this paper, we show that D2NN are vulnerable to our novel adversarial attack, Dynamic DNN Adversarial attacks (DDAS). Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that target classification accuracy, DDAS targets the IoT device resources such as the battery, latency, and so on. We show that our attack is effective under various attack scenarios with a high attack success rate. We also provide a retraining scheme as a countermeasure to DDAS and show its effectiveness.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:02","2023-09-19 10:37:02","","61-67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In one type of MCS service, the service platform estimates environmental data, such as temperature or carbon dioxide concentration, from data reported by the mobile devices of crowdsensing workers. However, due to the nature of collecting data from such varied and unknown users, there is a risk of data poisoning attacks, in which malicious workers intentionally send data with large errors to increase the estimation error of data. While existing studies have investigated data poisoning attacks and methods of preventing them assuming a single area, data poisoning attacks on multiple areas have not been studied. In this paper, we propose strategies for data poisoning attacks in MCS across multiple areas in which the environmental value is estimated at each area independently. The proposed methods optimize the number of malicious workers allocated to each area to maximize the effectiveness of the attacker. Using computer simulations, we show that the proposed methods generate errors in many areas and increase the total error among all areas.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:02","2023-09-19 10:37:02","","68-73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing methods for malware traffic detection on Tor can be classified as rule-based and network-based, both of which apply machine learning extensively. Tor malware traffic detection systems are often deployed in open network environments. Their machine learning systems are the first to be attacked by adversarial samples. To ensure that Tor is not abused, this paper proposes an Adversarial Learning-based Tor Malware Traffic Detection model, AL-TMTD. We generate realistic attack samples that can evade detection and use these samples to produce an augmented training set for producing hardened detectors. In such a way, we obtain a more resilient Tor malware traffic detection model that achieves adversarial robustness. We validate our proposal through an extensive experimental campaign that considers multiple machine learning algorithms and shadow models. We simulate the adversary to construct functionally approximate shadow models through black-box model extraction and generate adversarial samples to validate the adversarial robustness of our proposed AL-TMTD model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the average accuracy of AL-TMTD after the adversarial retraining is as high as 0.995 in detecting adversarial samples, which is 0.314 without the adversarial retraining, a significant improvement.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:02","2023-09-19 10:37:02","","74-79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a real-time framework to fully manipulate the 4G and 5G data-link and network communication to the base station (eNB/gNB). This is for experimenting and testing the security of data-link protocols such as Media Access Control (MAC), Radio Link Control (RLC), Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) and network protocols such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Non-access stratum (NAS). Although we focus on the base station, our framework is equally applicable for manipulating the communication to the user equipment (UE). An appealing feature of our framework is that it automatically constructs the protocol state machine during normal communication. This allows us to validate the response from the base station when it is subjected to unexpected packet sequences. Our framework also exposes an application programming interfaces (APIs) for designers to install custom attack scenarios. We have implemented our framework and used it to generate several (adversarial) scenarios that include injection of malformed and out-of-order packets as well as flooding certain packets. Our evaluation revealed crashes in OpenAirInterface (OAI) UE and gNB, as well as in Open5GS core network.

This demand cannot be addressed adequately as the infrastructure's transition process between different generations is slow. Fourth Generation (4G) relies on Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA), where a single user can occupy the same sub-channel, Orthogonality offers interference-free communication but for normal loaded scenarios, but under performs in overloaded scenarios. Whereas Fifth Generation (5G) is targeting more spectral efficiency by using the Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), allowing MTC devices to share the same resources in frequency and time. However, NOMA medium access techniques in general have a complex scheduler design as group users/devices with aligned correlations. In this study, we formulate and simulate a 4G/5G Uplink scheduler that is based on dual NOMA-OMA. The objective is to achieve a tangible improvement in the spectral and scheduling efficiency of the network.

This design causes packet errors at higher-power levels than the level used by multiple terminals due to the non-orthogonality. Our proposed analytical model reflects the packet errors due to this power level design to analyze the throughput more accurately than related works. Our analytical results highlighted that our proposed model underestimated the throughput by only 0.3% over the Monte Carlo simulation at fifteen power levels.

However, the integration of services and data coming from different providers is hindered by a rapidly evolving ecosystem of tools and techniques, introducing substantial delays and costs in solution design, deployment, testing, and refinement. Serverless computing is a novel cloud computing model where the customers' business logic, structured as lightweight functions, is automatically put into execution in response to an incoming event. This emergent paradigm promises to be an appealing solution, lowering the development and management barrier for the adaptation, integration, and roll-out of services. However, the ephemeral nature of serverless functions clashes with the necessity of creating and maintaining persistent connections to the various data providers. In this work, we present the Serverless Persistence Support (SPS) service, a novel, distributed, and scalable service implementing an adaptation layer able to improve data access performance from serverless functions. To validate our proposal, we conduct a thorough analysis on a realistic testbed, contrasting various data layer supports and assessing SPS performance when compared to the classic approach where connections and operations are executed inside the business logic.

The idea of co-designing these decisions has been recently proposed in the literature as a way to minimize delivery costs and traffic at the backbone Internet. However, related work does not take into account that every content exists in multiple versions/streaming qualities, or at best treats each version as a separate content, when it comes to caching. In this paper, we explore how transcoding a content at the edge could avoid placing multiple related versions of this content in the same cache, thus better utilizing capacity (leading to an increase of the CP's profit). To this end, we formulate the problem of jointly deciding on caching, recommendations, and user-transcoder assignments with the goal of increasing the profit (revenue minus the incurred costs). We propose an iterative algorithm that is based on a decomposition of the formulated problem into two subproblems. We show that both subproblems, although NP-hard, are equivalent to problems in the literature for which algorithms with approximation guarantees exist. Our numerical evaluations in realistic scenarios show that the proposed policy leads to important financial gains of up to 29% when compared to the scenario where edge transcoding is not exploited.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:06","2023-09-19 10:37:06","","147-153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the traditional centralized training framework imposes large latency, network burdens and high risk of privacy disclosure. As a promising distributed solution, federated learning involves the collaborative model training among edge devices, with the orchestration of a server to carry the capacities of low-latency and privacy preservation for AI -driven networks. To further improve the communication efficiency, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is capable of computing while transmitting data by exploiting the superposition property of wireless channels to harness the interference. However, gradient aggregation suffers from channel distortion induced by channel fading and noise, which may degrade the training performance. Moreover, it is beneficial to schedule the informative edge devices in federated learning under limited energy resources. In this work, we propose a dynamic device scheduling scheme for AirComp enabled federated learning systems. In this scheme, a proper number of qualified edge devices with channel inversion based power control are scheduled to participate the model training, where local updates diversity, channel condition and energy consumption are exploited jointly. Inspired by the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method, we formulate the optimization problem to attain the device selection strategy. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme can achieve a close-to-optimal test accuracy with fast convergence rate, and present good performance of robustness under different channel conditions.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:08","2023-09-19 10:37:08","","173-178","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, in each training iteration, FL nodes only upload the local training results to the centralized server without disclosure of their raw training dataset and the centralized server will aggregate the local results of all FL nodes and update the global model. To this end, the performance of the global model is highly dependent on the nodes' cooperation. However, it is challenging to motivate mobile edge devices to involve themselves in the FL process without a desired incentive. Another significant concern of the mobile edge devices is the communication and computational energy cost of participation. Therefore, considering the high cost and weak communication channel with the centralized server specially for the distant nodes, in this paper, we propose a relay-assisted energy efficient scheme for federated learning, where each FL computational node is not only motivated by monetary awards based on their local dataset, but also further motivated to function as a relay node to assist distant nodes on local results uploading due to its locality advantage. To achieve a stable pairing solution between FL computational nodes and assisted relays in a distributive fashion, a many-to-one matching algorithm is applied, where each the computational node and relay is unable to deviate with current pairing unilaterally for higher revenue. Extensive simulations are conducted to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed scheme.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:08","2023-09-19 10:37:08","","179-184","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with the frequently used generalized mutual information (GMI), the LM rate has been known as a tighter lower bound of the mismatch capacity. The computation of the LM rate,11To our best knowledge, the name LM rate first appeared in the reference [1]. The capital letter LM seems to be the abbreviation of Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity. however, has been a difficult task, due to the fact that the LM rate involves a maximization over a function of the channel input, which becomes challenging as the input alphabet size grows, and direct numerical methods (e.g., interior point methods) suffer from intensive memory and computational resource requirements. Noting that the computation of the LM rate can also be formulated as an entropy-based optimization problem with constraints, in this work, we transform the task into an optimal transport (OT) problem with an extra constraint. This allows us to efficiently and accurately accomplish our task by using the well-known Sinkhorn algorithm. Indeed, only a few iterations are required for convergence, due to the fact that the formulated problem does not contain additional regularization terms. Moreover, we convert the extra constraint into a root-finding procedure for a one-dimensional monotonic function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our OT approach to the computation of the LM rate.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:12","2023-09-19 10:37:12","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considered a severe and powerful attack, an injection of false data into the data (images) collected by the drones can considerably alter a final decision that the processing center may take. To fight against this attack, our proposal relies on image analysis and classification using a deep learning approach.

It utilizes a collection of sensors, or crowd, to perform various sensing tasks. As the sensors are battery operated and require a mechanism to recharge them, we consider energy harvesting (EH) sensors to form a sustainable sensing architecture. The execution of the sensing tasks is controlled by the mobile crowd-sensing platform (MCSP) which makes task allocation decisions, i.e., it decides whether or not to perform a task depending on the available resources, and if the task is to be performed, assigns it to suitable sensors. To make optimal allocation decisions, the MCSP requires perfect non-causal knowledge regarding the channel coefficients of the wireless links to the sensors, the amounts of energy the sensors harvest and the sensing tasks to be performed. However, in practical scenarios this non-causal knowledge is not available at the MCSP. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel Deep-Q-Network solution to find the task allocation strategy that maximizes the number of completed tasks using only realistic causal knowledge of the battery statuses of the available sensors. Through numerical evaluations we show that our proposed approach performs only 7.8% lower than the optimal solution.

We perform a series of experiments on the MNIST/CIFAR-10 datasets, in both lID and non-lID data settings. We compare the communication time of different aggregation schemes, in terms of iteration rounds and target accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the uploading time of the proposed scheme is up to 4.3 times shorter than other existing ones. Experiments on an end - to-end FL framework also verify the communication efficiency of CE-FedPA in a real-world setting.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:14","2023-09-19 10:37:14","","275-280","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, large model size and frequent model aggregation cause serious communication bottleneck for FL. To reduce the communication volume, techniques such as model compression and quantization have been proposed. Besides the fixed-bit quantization, existing adaptive quantization schemes use ascending-trend quantization, where the quantization level increases with the training stages. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of quantization on model convergence, and show that the optimal quantization level is directly related to the range of the model updates. Given the model is supposed to converge with the progress of the training, the range of the model updates will gradually shrink, indicating that the quantization level should decrease with the training stages. Based on the theoretical analysis, a descending quantization scheme named FedDQ is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed descending quantization scheme can save up to 65.2% of the communicated bit volume and up to 68% of the communication rounds, when compared with existing schemes.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:14","2023-09-19 10:37:14","","281-286","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A significant challenge is how to effectively use customers' power consumption data for energy theft detection while pre-serving security and privacy. One solution is to use federated learning (FL) to compute a global model to detect energy theft cyberattacks where detection stations train local models on their customers' power consumption data and send only the parameters of the models to an aggregator server. Nevertheless, revealing the model's parameters may still leak customers' private data by launching attacks such as membership and inference. Therefore, a secure aggregation scheme is needed to protect the models' param-eters. Furthermore, the existing privacy-preserving aggregation schemes suffer from high overhead and low model accuracy. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel privacy- preserving, efficient, decentralized, aggregation scheme based on a functional encryption cryptosystem for energy theft detection in smart grids without requiring a key distribution center. Our scheme enables the detection stations to send encrypted training parameters to an aggregator, which calculates the aggregated parameters and returns the updated model parameters to the detection stations without being able to learn the parameters of the local models or the training data of the customers to preserve their privacy. Moreover, the results of our extensive experiments show that our FL-based detector can detect energy thefts accurately with low overhead because of our lightweight privacy-preserving aggregation scheme.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:15","2023-09-19 10:37:15","","287-292","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, existing works implement machine-learning algorithms on the server and transmit the results to the mobile devices. Although the context-aware predictions made by the server are more accurate than their mobile counterpart is it heavily depends on the network connection for the delivery of the results to the devices, which negatively affects real-time context learning.

Furthermore mean-field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is adopted to allow each individual node in the MANET to dynamically select the appropriate contention window (CW) and gradually compute the global optimal policy.

The large-scale IoT network is modeled by a heterogeneous Poisson field (HPF) of interferers. Then, the AoI of the target link, with a single packet storage capability, is characterized via an absorbing Markov chain that accounts for the interwoven effects of packet size, transmission rate, and interfering IoT devices. In particular, the proposed model investigates the impact of packet segmentation in order to operate at a reliable rate in the presence of IoT interference. To this end, the AoI of preemptive and non-preemptive transmission schemes are studied and compared. Comparing the AoIs of the preemptive and non-preemptive transmission schemes, the results show that no scheme always outperforms the other.

This paper studies an uplink-aided downlink channel estimation scheme targeting high-mobility user scenario based on a frequency division duplex massive MIMO-OTFS system. Most of the existing work over-looks the change in the delay, Doppler, and angle domain during a channel estimation process due to high mobility.

Simulation results demonstrate that an uplink channel may change significantly in a high-mobility massive MIMO-OTFS system, given a reasonably small amount of processing latency.

DTN routing is commonly designed to either minimize the end-to-end data forwarding latency or maximize throughput without paying much attention to the close interrelation between the two metrics. When used in isolation, results may be conflicting, e.g., achieve low latency by routing bundles through paths with a high drop rate, that is, low throughput. A comparative analysis of the theoretical performance of a latency-only, inverse throughput-only, and combined routing objective is provided by modeling the system with a finite Continuous Time Markov Chain. The Pareto front of the multi-objective latency-throughput routing case is discussed and approached with the inverse of Kleinrock's power metric and a simplified variant.

This work presents a comprehensive measurement study on the latency and reliability performance of Wi-Fi 6 and compares it to performance of Wi-Fi 5. The baseline scenario measurements reveal a significant latency reduction of Wi-Fi 6 compared to Wi-Fi 5 especially for larger number of stations and especially in uplink direction. Since Wi-Fi 6 operates in unlicensed bands like its predecessors, the influence of interfering networks on the communication performance is an important aspect. Our evaluation shows that interfering traffic can significantly increase the latency and packet loss experienced by Wi-Fi 6 for smaller operation bandwidths, while for larger bandwidth of 80 MHz and resulting lower relative network load Wi-Fi 6 can still provide 99-percentile latency below 10 ms in the evaluated scenario. Overall, the achieved results with Wi-Fi 6 are promising, but further evaluations especially on the effect of different OFDMA scheduling algorithms and configurations is needed to evaluate its potential for demanding applications.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:22","2023-09-19 10:37:22","","377-382","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider a very challenging practical scenario where multiple background nodes might incorporate heterogeneous and generic traffic models; all the nodes contend for the transmission channel through the practical IEEE 802.11 based medium access control (MAC) protocol. The existing AoI analyses over distributed MAC protocol are not sufficient for our problem, which are limited to simplified MAC modeling or homogeneous traffic modeling. We propose an AoI optimization algorithm that integrates the AoI queueing analysis with the 802.11 MAC performance analysis. Specifically, we develop an innovative method to address the impact of the MAC channel attention on the message service time of the tagged node and compute the minimal AoI iteratively. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm is very accurate and robust crossing a variety of networking scenarios. Moreover, our methods require only local computation and slight probing of the conditional collision probability, making them suitable for practical use.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:22","2023-09-19 10:37:22","","383-388","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In large-scale resilient overlay networks (RONs), OWD measurements can be used for shortest path selection and troubleshooting. However, OWD measurements remain difficult because of the need for precise time synchronization. Especially in large-scale networks, clock synchronization of all nodes has always been a considerable challenge. Therefore, in many cases, people use half of the round-trip time (RTT/2) as a rough substitute for the OWD. This paper presents an efficient and easy-to-deploy scheme for large-scale OWD measurements with the algorithm ClockConverger at its core. The scheme consists of three steps: Firstly, we perform low-precision time synchronization for all the measured nodes relying on network time protocol daemons (ntpd); Then, we use the open-source tool OWPing to perform OWD measurements; Finally, we correct the errors of the measured OWDs with our proposed ClockConverger. The theory and experiments show that our scheme's accuracy is significantly better than RTT/2. Meanwhile, the complexity of ClockConverger is $O(n^{2})$, which is much lower than the exponential complexity of the existing Maximum-Entropy algorithm.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:23","2023-09-19 10:37:23","","395-400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the high mobility and channel attenuation in vehicular environment, it becomes more challenging to establish an efficient mmWave Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) communication. To overcome the beam misalignment problem, it is necessary to employ fast and reliable beamforming methods at the transmitter and receiver sides to align the beams reliably and continuously. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning approach based on beam alignment that suggests a bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) model followed by a fully connected layer, to predict the suitable beam pair in real time, i.e., the Angle of Departure (AoD) at the mmWave base station side and Angle of Arrival (AoA) at vehicle side (AoD/AoA) for which the received signal power is maximized. The BiLSTM-BPP is performed to identify automatically the strongest beam pair that connects the mmBS to the vehicle for each vehicle position. After a set of simulations, the obtained results showed that BiLSTM-BPP achieves the lowest beam prediction error between the predicted and the real AoD/AoA compared to existing traditional machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision tree, random forest.

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) provides the deterministic mechanism guar-antee for these demands, but with an open scheduling problem. For the low-latency and low-jitter traffic, it is hard to schedule in a scalable way, that is, increasing the scheduling speed under the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, this paper constructs a no-wait forwarding (NW-TAS) model with a time-aware shaper to eliminate the queuing delay and jitter, and further converts it into a flow-aware model by divisibility theory for scheduling simplification. With the converted model, an interval transformation-based method is proposed to get the analytical expression of feasible scheduling for each flow. Then, a flow-aware NW- TAS scheduling algorithm (FANS) with cyclic interval searching is designed to compress invalid search spaces.

This hybrid network might be realized by using multipath TCP (MPTCP), where Wi-Fi and LiFi paths can be simultaneously employed to potentially boost the total throughput of Wi-Fi while increasing the resilience towards network failure of LiFi due to, for example, blockage. However, naively implementing MPTCP in a hybrid Wi-Fi and LiFi network can yield an unexpected result, such as a lower throughput compared to the single-path TCP due to a Head-of-Line delay during the slow start phase of the TCP congestion control. Even though this problem can be avoided by improving the existing flow control or congestion control of TCP, these solutions still lack intelligent decision making that can improve the adaptability of MPTCP. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model-augmented deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to intelligently steer MPTCP subflows (i.e., TCP connections) by using a close-to-reality scenario emulated by considering random orientation, random blockage, and random mobility of Wi-Fi-and-LiFi-enabled mobile devices.

However, the moving aerial access point leads to highly dynamic inter-layer links, and it is challenging to capture the dynamics when solving the GSUS problem. In this paper, we resort to a non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation to make intelligent GSUS decisions in dynamic SAGINs. Unfortunately, conventional reinforcement learning (RL) is not applicable to solving the non-stationary MDP problem. To this end, we use the Dynamic Parameter Markov Decision Process (DP-MDP) to decompose the non-stationary MDP into a sequence of stationary MDPs, and then encode them with latent parameters, facilitating policy transfer between similar MDPs.

Emergency communication (EC) is essential to promptly inform UAVs of potential danger to avoid accidents, whereas the conventional communication-only feedback-based methods, which separate the digital and physical identities (DPI), bring intolerable latency and disturb the unintended receivers. In this paper, we present a novel DPI-Mapping solution to match the identities (IDs) of UAVs from dual domains for visual networking, which is the first solution that enables UAVs to communicate promptly with what they see without the tedious exchange of beacons. The IDs are distinguished dynamically by defining feature similarity, and the asymmetric IDs from different domains are matched via the proposed bio-inspired matching algorithm.

Specifically, due to the high cost of SAR image acquisition and the low occurrence probability of high-value targets, it is of great importance to identify SAR targets with only a few available images, which is referred to as few-shot SAR target classification. However, most existing solutions straightly adopt meta-learning and transfer learning methods that are originally designed for optical images, which do not consider the unique frequency information of SAR images. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid classification network that combines both spatial and frequency information for few-shot SAR target classification. Specifically, we first train the proposed network in a source dataset, which contains a large number of related SAR images without the targets of interest. Then, the pre-trained network is fine-tuned on the target dataset consisting of only a few SAR images of interest. Compared with the conventional method based on convolutional neural networks and model-agnostic meta-learning, the proposed method can achieve superior top-1 accuracy in various settings.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:29","2023-09-19 10:37:29","","480-485","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Express trajectory consists of a large amount of community paths which is different from the trajectory of transportation tools such as taxis which run in the main road of a city. Due to the complexity of the community road networks and the energy constraint of devices, trajectories are collected under a low sampling rate and accuracy. These trajectories need to be recovered and mapped to the road networks for further analysis. Current recovery approaches utilize two-stage or end-to-end models to generate the upsampled trajectories. These methods fail to fully exploit the periodicity relation in historical data, which leads to accuracy losses for complex community road networks. In this paper, we design PATR, a periodicity-aware Seq2Seq model, to recover the couriers' trajectories by leveraging the periodical patterns of the historical data. We conduct experimental evaluations based on real-world GPS data of JD logistics consisting of 836,959 points and 25,726 road segments, and our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by reducing recovery error by 2.4%-21.9%.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:29","2023-09-19 10:37:29","","486-491","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In most of the current literature, FL has been studied for supervised ML tasks, in which edge devices collect labeled data. Nevertheless, in many applications, it is impractical to assume existence of labeled data across devices. To this end, we develop a novel methodology, Cooperative Federated unsupervised Contrastive Learning (CF-CL), for FL across edge devices with unlabeled datasets. CF-CL employs local device cooperation where data are exchanged among devices through device-to-device (D2D) communications to avoid local model bias resulting from non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) local datasets. CF-CL introduces a push-pull smart data sharing mechanism tailored to unsupervised FL settings, in which, each device pushes a subset of its local datapoints to its neighbors as reserved datapoints, and pulls a set of datapoints from its neighbors, sampled through a probabilistic importance sampling technique. We demonstrate that CF-CL leads to (i) alignment of unsupervised learned latent spaces across devices, (ii) faster global convergence, allowing for less frequent global model aggregations; and (iii) is effective in extreme non-i.i.d. datasettings across the devices.","2022-12-04","2023-09-19 10:37:30","2023-09-19 10:37:30","","492-497","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, secure authentication and key agreement protocol, namely 5G-AKA, has been proposed in the literature to safely and stably access the 5G mobile services. However, some recent findings reveal that 5G-AKA and its numerous versions based on symmetric or asymmetric encryption are either vulnerable to different attacks such as perfect forward secrecy violation, malicious Serving Network (SN), de-synchronization attack, privacy theft, stolen device, or are computationally intensive. Apart from that, these protocols use single-factor authentication. Considering the above demerits of these protocols and the necessity to provide enhanced security, we propose an Elliptic Curve-Cryptography (ECC)-based multi-factor 5G-AKA authentication protocol. It provides additional security and achieves cost-effectiveness in terms of computational, communication, storage costs and energy consumption. The formal security analysis using Real-Or-Random (ROR) logic has been done to confirm its security. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol in terms of computational, communication, storage costs and energy consumption.

In this work, we characterize the capacity region of such a quantum switch under noisy channel transmissions and imperfect quantum operations. We express the capacity region as a function of the channel and network parameters (link and entanglement swap success probability), entanglement purification yield and application level parameters (target fidelity threshold). In particular, we provide necessary conditions to verify if a set of request rates belong to the capacity region of the switch. We use these conditions to find the maximum achievable end-to-end user entanglement generation throughput by solving a set of linear optimization problems. We develop a max-weight scheduling policy and prove that the policy stabilizes the switch for all feasible request arrival rates.

The ineffectiveness and high cost of state-of-the-art tracking approaches are rooted in their adherence to the industry's simplicity principle, which leads to their stateless nature, performing gimbal rotations based only on the latest object detection. To address the issues, we design and implement WiseCam that wisely tunes the pan-tilt cameras to minimize mechanical rotation costs while maintaining long-term object tracking.

However, they rely on sub-optimal routing approaches that fail to achieve their designed capacity. This paper proposes a process for designing optimal oblivious routing that is programmed compactly on programmable switches. The process consists of three contributions in tandem. We first transform a robust optimization problem for designing oblivious routing into a linear program, which is solvable in polynomial time but cannot scale for datacenter topologies. We then prove that the repeated structures in a datacenter topology lead to a structured optimal solution. We use this insight to formulate a scalable linear program, so an optimal oblivious routing solution is obtained in polynomial time for large-scale topologies. For real-world deployment, the optimal solution is converted into forwarding rules for programmable switches with stringent memory. With this constraint, we utilize the repeated structures in the optimal solution to group the forwarding rules, resulting in compact forwarding rules with a much smaller memory requirement. Extensive evaluations show our process i) obtains optimal solutions faster and more scalable than a state-of-the-art technique and ii) reduces the memory requirement by no less than 90% for most considered topologies.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:15","2023-09-19 10:38:15","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then present SaTCP, a cross-layer solution that enables TCP to avoid overly conservative congestion control and improve its performance under high LEO link dynamics. As an upgrade to CUBIC TCP, SaTCP forecasts the time of disruptive events (i.e., satellite handovers or route updates) by tactfully utilizing the predictability of satellite locations, taking into account the prediction inaccuracy, and informs TCP to adapt its decision accordingly.

With the ever-growing HAR system deployment, the vulnerability of such systems has been revealed. However, existing efforts in HAR adversarial attacks only focus on untargeted attacks. In this paper, we propose the first targeted adversarial attacks against mmWave-based HAR through designed universal perturbation. A practical iteration algorithm is developed to craft perturbations that generalize well across different activity samples without additional training overhead. Different from existing work that only develops adversarial attacks for a particular mmWave-based HAR model, we improve the practicability of our attacks by broadening our target to the two most common mmWave-based HAR models (i.e., voxel-based and heatmap-based).

Most of the existing works adopt phase-modulated schemes to embed tag data, which suffer from three drawbacks: symbol-level modulation limitation, heavy synchronization accuracy reliance, and small symbol time offset (STO) / carrier frequency (CFO) offset tolerability. We introduce SubScatter, the first subcarrier-level frequency-modulated OFDM backscatter which is able to tolerate bigger synchronization errors, STO, and CFO. The unique feature that sets SubScatter apart from the other backscatter systems is our subcarrier shift keying (SSK) modulation. This method pushes the modulation granularity to the subcarrier by encoding and mapping tag data into different subcarrier patterns. We also design a tandem frequency shift (TFS) scheme that enables SSK with low cost and low power. For decoding, we propose a correlation-based method that decodes tag data from the correlation between the original and backscatter OFDM symbols. We prototype and test SubScatter under 802.11g OFDM WiFi signals. Comprehensive evaluations show that our SubScatter outstands prior works in terms of effectiveness and robustness. Specifically, SubScatter has 743kbps throughput, 3.1× and 14.9× higher than RapidRider and MOXcatter, respectively. It also has a much lower BER under noise and interferences, which is over 6× better than RapidRider or MOXcatter.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:16","2023-09-19 10:38:16","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lately, stateless multicast protocols, such as BIER, have been proposed to solve the excessive routing states problem of traditional multicast protocols. However, the high complexity of multicast tree computation and the limited scalability for concurrent requests still pose daunting challenges, especially under dynamic group membership. In this paper, we propose Hawkeye, a dynamic and stateless multicast mechanism with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. For real-time responses to multicast requests, we leverage DRL enhanced by a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to model the sequential feature of dynamic group membership and thus is able to build multicast trees proactively for upcoming requests. Moreover, an innovative source aggregation mechanism is designed to help the DRL agent converge when faced with a large amount of multicast requests, and relieve ingress routers from excessive routing states. Evaluation with real-world topologies and multicast requests demonstrates that Hawkeye adapts well to dynamic multicast: it reduces the variation of path latency by up to 89.5% with less than 12% additional bandwidth consumption compared with the theoretical optimum.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:16","2023-09-19 10:38:16","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces a novel information-sharing mechanism to opportunistically improve the vehicles’ local environment estimates via infrastructure-assisted collaborative sensing, while still allowing them to operate autonomously when no assistance is available. As vehicles might have different sensing capabilities, combining and sharing information from a judiciously selected subset is often sufficient to considerably improve all the vehicles’ estimation errors. We develop an opportunistic framework for vehicular collaborative sensing determining (1) which nodes require assistance, (2) which ones are best suited to provide it, and (3) the corresponding information-sharing rates, so as to minimize the communication overheads while meeting the vehicles’ target estimation error. We leverage the supermodularity of the problem to devise an efficient vehicle information sharing algorithm with suboptimality guarantees to solve this problem and make it suitable to deploy in dynamic environments where network conditions might fluctuate rapidly. We support our analysis with simulations showing evidence that vehicles can considerably benefit from the proposed opportunistic collaborative sensing framework compared to operating autonomously. Finally, we explore the value of information-sharing in vehicular collaborative sensing networks by evaluating the associated safe driving velocity gains.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:17","2023-09-19 10:38:17","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent fingerprinting methods employ the physical-layer signal, which embeds the tag hardware imperfections for authentication. However, existing NFC fingerprinting methods suffer from either low scalability for a large number of tags or incompatibility with NFC protocols, impeding the practical application of NFC authentication systems. To fill this gap, we propose NFChain, a new NFC fingerprinting scheme that excavates the tag hardware uniqueness from the protocol-agnostic tag response signal. Specifically, we harness an agile and compatible frequency band of NFC to extract the tag fingerprint from a chain of tag responses over multiple frequencies, which significantly improves fingerprint scalability. However, extracting the desired fingerprint encounters two practical challenges: (1) fingerprint inconsistency under different NFC reader and tag configurations and (2) fingerprint variations across multiple measurements of the same tag due to the signal noise in generic readers. To tackle these challenges, we first design an effective nulling method to eliminate the effect of device configurations. Second, we employ contrastive learning to reduce fingerprint variations for accurate authentication. Extensive experiments show we can achieve as low as 3.7% FRR and 4.1% FAR for over 600 tags.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:17","2023-09-19 10:38:17","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they often cause privacy issues when collected from individuals. To address this problem, most existing works perturb the values in the time series while retaining their temporal order, which may lead to significant distortion of the values. Recently, we propose TLDP model [45] that perturbs temporal perturbation to ensure privacy guarantee while retaining original values. It has shown great promise to achieve significantly higher utility than value perturbation mechanisms in many time series analysis. However, its practicability is still undermined by two factors, namely, utility cost of extra missing or empty values, and inflexibility of privacy budget settings. To address them, in this paper we propose switch as a new two-way operation for temporal perturbation, as opposed to the one-way dispatch operation in [45]. The former inherently eliminates the cost of missing, empty or repeated values. Optimizing switch operation in a stateful manner, we then propose StaSwitch mechanism for time series release under TLDP. Through both analytical and empirical studies, we show that StaSwitch has significantly higher utility for the published time series than any state-of-the-art temporal- or value-perturbation mechanism, while allowing any combination of privacy budget settings.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:18","2023-09-19 10:38:18","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mobility of physical objects and dynamic query arrivals make efficient service provisioning in MEC become challenging.

In this work, we propose a clustered FL framework, MCFL, to minimize the job completion time by mitigating the influence of non-IID data and the straggler effect while guaranteeing the FL model convergence performance. MCFL builds upon a two-stage operation: i) a clustering algorithm constructs clusters, each containing clients with similar computing and communications capabilities to combat the straggler effect within a cluster; ii) a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on soft actor-critic with discrete actions intelligently selects a subset of clients from each cluster to mitigate the impact of non-IID data, and derives the number of intra-cluster aggregation iterations for each cluster to reduce the straggler effect among clusters. Extensive testbed experiments are conducted under various configurations to verify the efficacy of MCFL.

FL algorithms (like FedAvg) iteratively aggregate model updates computed by clients on their own datasets. Clients may exhibit different levels of participation, often correlated over time and with other clients. This paper presents the first convergence analysis for a FedAvg-like FL algorithm under heterogeneous and correlated client availability. Our analysis highlights how correlation adversely affects the algorithm’s convergence rate and how the aggregation strategy can alleviate this effect at the cost of steering training toward a biased model. Guided by the theoretical analysis, we propose CA-Fed, a new FL algorithm that tries to balance the conflicting goals of maximizing convergence speed and minimizing model bias. To this purpose, CA-Fed dynamically adapts the weight given to each client and may ignore clients with low availability and large correlation.

Peer content sharing (PCS) enables edge devices to share the cached contents with others, and can further increase the caching efficiency. While many efforts have been made to content caching or sharing technologies, it remains open to study the complicated technical and economic interplay between both technologies. In this paper, we propose a joint MEC-PCS framework, and focus on capturing the strategic interactions between different types of edge devices. Specifically, we model their interactions as a non-cooperative game, where each device (player) can choose to be an agent (who caches and shares contents with others) or a requester (who doesn’t cache but requests contents from others) of each content. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of the game equilibrium systematically under the generic usage-based pricing (for PCS). To address the incomplete information issue, we further design a behavior rule that allows players to achieve the equilibrium via a dynamic learning algorithm.

In this paper, we introduce the theory of achieving spatial diversity in such single-antenna systems by using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). Our approach, called ‘RIS-STAR’, proposes a method of proactively perturbing the wireless propagation environment multiple times within the symbol time (that is less than the channel coherence time) through reconfiguring an RIS. By leveraging the stationarity of the channel, RIS-STAR ensures that the only source of perturbation is due to the chosen and controllable RIS configuration. We first formulate the problem to find the set of RIS configurations that maximizes channel hardening, which is a measure of link reliability. Our solution is independent of the transceiver’s relative location with respect to the RIS and does not require channel estimation, alleviating two key implementation concerns. We then evaluate the performance of RIS-STAR using a custom-simulator and an experimental testbed composed of PCB-fabricated RIS. Specifically, we demonstrate how a SISO link can be enhanced to perform similar to a SIMO link attaining an 84.6% channel hardening improvement in presence of strong multipath and non-line-of-sight conditions.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:21","2023-09-19 10:38:21","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies consider using cameras or wearable sensors for expression recognition. However, these approaches bring considerable privacy concerns or extra device burdens. Moreover, the recognition performance of camera-based methods deteriorates when users are wearing masks. In this paper, we propose FacER, an active acoustic facial expression recognition system. As a software solution on a smartphone, FacER avoids the extra costs of external microphone arrays. Facial expression features are extracted by modeling the echoes of emitted near-ultrasound signals between the earpiece speaker and the 3D facial contour. Besides isolating a range of background noises, FacER is designed to identify different expressions from various users with a limited set of training data. To achieve this, we propose a contrastive external attention-based model to learn consistent expression features across different users. Extensive experiments with 20 volunteers with or without masks show that FacER can recognize 6 common facial expressions with more than 85% accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art acoustic sensing approach by 10% in various real-life scenarios. FacER provides a more robust solution for recognizing facial expressions in a convenient and usable manner.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:22","2023-09-19 10:38:22","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the mmWave beams are susceptible to misalignments and blockages caused by user movements. As a result, mmWave channels are vulnerable to large fluctuations in quality, which in turn, cause disproportionate degradation in end-to-end performance of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) based applications. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) integrated transport-layer plugin, Millimeter wave based Immersive Agent (MIA), for immersive content delivery over the mmWave link. MIA uses the RL model to predict mmWave link bandwidth based on the real-time measurement. Then, MIA cooperates with TCP’s congestion control scheme to adapt the sending rate in accordance with the predictions of the mmWave bandwidth. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MIA, we conduct experiments using a mmWave augmented immersive testbed and network simulations. The evaluation results show that MIA improves end-to-end immersive performance significantly on both throughput and latency.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:22","2023-09-19 10:38:22","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we compare Read-Copy-Update (RCU) and Readers-Writer lock (RWL) as shared-memory synchronization primitives on the update freshness. To demonstrate the tension between readers and writers accessing shared-memory, we consider a network scenario with a pair of coupled updating processes. Location updates of a mobile terminal are written to a shared-memory Forwarder Information Base (FIB) at a network forwarder. An application server sends ""app updates"" to the mobile terminal via the forwarder. Arriving app updates at forwarder are addressed (by reading the FIB) and forwarded to the mobile terminal. If a FIB read returns an outdated address, the misaddressed app update is lost in transit. We redesign these reader and writer processes using preemption mechanisms that improve the timeliness of updates. We present a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework to analyze location and app update age processes and show how these two age processes are coupled through synchronization primitives.

In this paper, we propose AvatarHunter, a non-intrusive and user-unconscious de-anonymization attack based on victims’ inherent movement signatures. AvatarHunter imperceptibly collects the victim avatar’s gait information via recording videos from multiple views in the VR scenario without requiring any permission. A Unity-based feature extractor is designed that preserves the avatar’s movement signature while immune to the avatar’s appearance changes.

In practice, the decision maker can obtain (relatively accurate) channel information, e.g., through beamforming in mmWave networks, right before data transmission. However, frequent beamforming incurs a formidable overhead in densely deployed mmWave WLANs. In this paper, we consider the important problem of throughput optimization with joint link probing and scheduling. The problem is challenging even when the link rate distributions are pre-known (the offline setting) due to the necessity of balancing the information gains from probing and the cost of reducing the data transmission opportunity. We develop an approximation algorithm with guaranteed performance when the probing decision is non-adaptive and a dynamic programming-based solution for the more challenging adaptive setting. We further extend our solutions to the online setting with unknown link rate distributions and develop a contextual-bandit based algorithm and derive its regret bound.

Most of the prior work and proposals assume an on-demand distribution of entanglements which may result in significant network resource under-utilization. In this work, we introduce Quantum Overlay Networks (QONs) for efficient entanglement distribution in quantum networks. When the demand to create end-to-end user entanglements is low, QONs can generate and store maximally entangled Bell pairs (EPR pairs) at specific overlay storage nodes of the network. Later, during peak demands, requests can be served by performing entanglement swaps either over a direct path from the network or over a path using the storage nodes. We solve the link entanglement and storage resource allocation problem in such a QON using a centralized optimization framework. We evaluate the performance of our proposed QON architecture over a wide number of network topologies under various settings using extensive simulation experiments. Our results demonstrate that QONs fare well by a factor of 40% with respect to meeting surge and changing demands compared to traditional non-overlay proposals. QONs also show significant improvement in terms of average entanglement request service delay over non-overlay approaches.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:23","2023-09-19 10:38:23","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The statistics of the completion time and the reward distributions of all task types are unknown to the controller. The controller needs to learn to schedule tasks to maximize the accumulated reward within a given time horizon T . Motivated by the practical scenarios, we require the designed policy to satisfy a system throughput constraint. In addition, we introduce the interruption mechanism to terminate ongoing tasks that last longer than certain deadlines. To address this scheduling problem, we model it as an online learning problem with deadline and throughput constraints.

We present AutoManager, a novel meta-learning model that can support complex MANO tasks by addressing these two challenges. Our solution learns how multiple intertwined predictions affect a common performance goal, and steers them so as to attain the correct operation point under a-priori unknown loss functions.

However, current solutions such as flex sensors and computer vision methods have limitations, such as the limited system lifetime of battery-powered flex sensors and the failure of computer vision methods in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an RFID-based flex-sensor system, called RFlexor, which enables batteryless flex-angle detection in NLoS scenarios. RFlexor utilizes the change in tag phase and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) caused by the flexing of the tag to detect flex-angles. To extract the complex relationship between tag phase/RSSI and flex-angle, we train a multi-input AI model. We address the significant technical challenges by reformulating the phase and RSSI models, using phase difference and RSSI ratio as inputs, and applying multi-head attention to fuse phase and RSSI data. We implement the RFlexor system using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID devices and conduct extensive experiments. The results show that RFlexor achieves fine-grained flex-angle detection with a detection error of fewer than 10 degrees and a probability higher than 90% in most conditions. The average detection error is always less than 10 degrees across all experiments.

To this end, Radio Access Network (RAN) resources will need to be carefully ""sliced"" to satisfy heterogeneous application requirements while minimizing RAN usage. Existing slicing frameworks treat each DL task as equal and inflexibly define the resources to assign to each task, which leads to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose SEM-O-RAN, the first semantic and flexible slicing framework for NextG Open RANs. Our key intuition is that different DL classifiers can tolerate different levels of image compression, due to the semantic nature of the target classes. Therefore, compression can be semantically applied so that the networking load can be minimized. Moreover, flexibility allows SEM-O-RAN to consider multiple edge allocations leading to the same task-related performance, which significantly improves system-wide performance as more tasks can be allocated. First, we mathematically formulate the Semantic Flexible Edge Slicing Problem (SF-ESP), demonstrate that it is NP-hard, and provide an approximation algorithm to solve it efficiently.

In such systems, an information source can deliver its data update only when 1) there is energy in the battery; and 2) this source is selected to transmit its data update based on the transmission scheduling policy. This work analyzes how the energy arrival pattern of each source and the transmission scheduling policy jointly influence the average AoI among multiple sources and develops the closed-form expression of average AoI by analyzing its theoretical properties. For the unit battery case, the closed-form expression of the average AoI under the Stationary Randomized Sampling (SRS) policy space is derived, and the optimal policy is proposed by analyzing the KKT conditions. For the arbitrary finite battery size, the closed-form expression of AoI under SRS policy space with infinite battery capacity is first analyzed. Then based on the result, we construct a proper weight function in Lyapunov optimization to develop a policy named Max Energy-Aware Weight (MEAW), which is proved to achieve 2-approximation in the full policy space. Experimental results validate the theoretical results and show that MEAW performs close to the theoretical lower bound and outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:27","2023-09-19 10:38:27","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior works extensively focus on improving AoI in single-hop or multi-hop networks with fixed paths. However, the issue of multi-path transmission is overlooked. In this paper, we make the first attempt to address the issue of minimizing AoI through link scheduling in UOWSNs (termed MAKE problem). To minimize AoI, we propose an AoI model and corresponding link constraint model for multi-path and multi-hop UOWSNs. Then, we formalize the MAKE problem into a submodular function maximization problem, and propose a greedy method with an approximation ratio guarantee to solve it. Theoretical analyses are presented to explore the features of our scheme. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, extensive simulations are conducted. The results reveal that the proposed scheme has 21.4% lower total average AoI compared with other baseline algorithms. Furthermore, test-bed experiments are carried out to verify the applicability of the proposed scheme in practical applications.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:27","2023-09-19 10:38:27","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, finding an optimal RIS configuration when CSI is outdated is challenging. To this end, this work aims to provide practical insights into the tradeoff between the outdatedness of the CSI and the system performance by using the effective capacity as analytical tool. We consider a RIS-enabled mmWave downlink where the base station (BS) operates under statistical quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. We find a closed-form expression for the effective capacity that incorporates the degree of optimism of packet scheduling and correlation strength between instantaneous and outdated CSI. Moreover, our analysis allows us to find optimal values of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) distribution parameter and their impact on the effective capacity in different network scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that better effective capacity can be achieved with suboptimal RIS configuration when the channel estimates are known to be outdated. It allows us to design system parameters that guarantee better performance while keeping the complexity and cost associated with channel estimation to a minimum.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:28","2023-09-19 10:38:28","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We see that real 5G experience is not that satisfactory as anticipated. It is mainly because faster 5G is not used as it can and should. We have several surprising findings: Despite huge speed potentials (say, up to several hundreds of Mbps), more than half are not realized in practice; Such under-utilization is mainly stemmed from current practice and policies that manage radio resource in a performance-oblivious manner; 5G is even less used where 5G is co-deployed over both mmWave and Sub-6GHz bands; Transiently missing 5G is not uncommon and its negative impacts last much longer.

However, different shards’ independent and random scheduling for cross-shard transactions results in numerous conflicts and aborts, since cross-shard transactions from different shards may access the same account. A deterministic ordering can eliminate conflicts by determining a global order for transactions before processing, as proved in the database field. Unfortunately, due to the intertwining of the Byzantine environment and information isolation among shards, there is no trusted party able to predetermine such an order for cross-shard transactions. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes Prophet, a conflict-free sharding blockchain based on Byzantine-tolerant deterministic ordering. It first depends on untrusted self-organizing coalitions of nodes from different shards to pre-execute cross-shard transactions for prerequisite information about ordering. It then determines a trusted global order based on stateless ordering and post-verification for pre-executed results, through shard cooperation. Following the order, the shards thus orderly execute and commit transactions without conflicts. Prophet orchestrates the pre-execution, ordering, and execution processes in the sharding consensus for minimal overhead. We rigorously prove the determinism and serializability of transactions under the Byzantine and sharded environment. An evaluation of our prototype shows that Prophet improves the throughput by 3.11× and achieves nearly no aborts on 1 million Ethereum transactions compared with state-of-the-art sharding.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:28","2023-09-19 10:38:28","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To combine sketch with INT and preserve their advantages, a representative approach is to use INT to send a switch sketch in small pieces (called sketchlets) to end-host for reconstructing an identical sketch. However, in this paper, we show that when naively selecting buckets to add to sketchlets, the end-host reconstructed sketch is inaccurate. To overcome this problem, we present DUNE, an innovative sketch-INT network measurement system. DUNE incorporates two key innovations: First, we design a novel scatter sketchlet that is more efficient in transferring measurement data by allowing a switch to select individual buckets to add to sketchlets; Second, we propose lightweight data structures for tracing ""freshness"" of the sketch buckets, and present algorithms for smartly selecting buckets that contain valuable measurement data to send to end-host.

In this paper, we propose the Crow application programming interface (API) that allows web applications to access other devices’ I/O through standard web APIs without modifying operating systems or browsers. The provision of cross-device I/O should resolve two key challenges. First, the web environment lacks support for device discovery when making a device-to-device connection. This requires a significant effort for developers to implement and maintain signaling servers. To address this challenge, we propose a serverless Crow connectivity mechanism using devices’ I/O-specific communication schemes. Second, JavaScript runtimes have limitations in supporting cross-device inter-process communication (IPC). To solve the problem, we propose a web IPC scheme, called Crow IPC, which introduces a proxy interface that relays the cross-device IPC connection. Crow IPC also provides a mechanism for ensuring functional consistency. We implemented the Crow API as a JavaScript library with which developers can easily develop their applications.

FVCS platforms aim to jointly optimize both the order-serving revenue as well as sensing coverage and quality. However, such two objectives are often conflicting and need to be balanced according to the platforms’ preferences on both objectives. To address this problem, we propose a novel cooperative multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, referred to as MOVDN, to serve as the first preference-configurable order dispatch mechanism for FVCS platforms. Specifically, MOVDN adopts a decomposed network structure, which enables agents to make distributed order selection decisions, and meanwhile aligns each agent’s local decision with the global objectives of the FVCS platform. Then, we propose a novel algorithm to train a single universal MOVDN that is optimized over the space of all preferences. This allows our trained model to produce the optimal policy for any preference. Furthermore, we provide the theoretical convergence guarantee and sample efficiency analysis of our algorithm.

In particular, we formulate the constellation-wide EO data multi-path download (CEOMD) problem, which aims at minimizing the delivery completion time of requested data for all EO sources. We prove the hardness of solving CEOMD, and further present a heuristic multipath routing and bandwidth allocation mechanism to tackle the technical challenges caused by time-varying satellite dynamics and flow contention, and solve the CEOMD problem efficiently.

Accordingly, we are able to build up the multi-modal prototype with just voice assistants and Wi-Fi routers. To track the movement of silent users, our insights are as follows: (1) the voice assistants can hear the sound of the user’s pace, and then extract which direction the user is in; (2) we can extract the user’s velocity from the Wi-Fi signal.

However, when sensor nodes are deployed in dynamic environments (e.g., maritime environments) where sensors move randomly over time, existing approaches are likely to incur significant performance loss or even fail to execute normally. In this work, we focus on serving dynamic nodes whose locations vary randomly and formalize the dynamic WRSN charging utility maximization problem (termed MATA problem). Through discretizing candidate charging locations and modeling the dynamic charging process, we propose a near-optimal algorithm for maximizing charging utility. Moreover, we point out the long-short-term conflict of dynamic sensors that their location distributions in the short-term usually deviate from the long-term expectations. To tackle this issue, we further design an online learning algorithm based on the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) model. It iteratively adjusts the charging strategy and adapts well to nodes’ short-term location deviations.

Prior to deployment, a DNN is specialized by training to fit the target use scenario (depending on computing power and visual data input). To handle its costly training and meet diverse deployment needs, a ""Train Once, Deploy Everywhere"" paradigm has been recently proposed by training one super-network and selecting one out of many sub-networks (part of the super-network) for the target scenario; This empowers efficient DNN deployment at low training cost (training once). However, the existing studies tackle some deployment factors like computing power and source data but largely overlook the impact of their runtime dynamics (say, time-varying visual contents and GPU/CPU workloads).

However, standard cameras easily suffer from motion blur under high moving speeds and low-quality image under poor illumination, which brings challenges for drones to perform motion tracking. Recently, a kind of bio-inspired sensors called event cameras emerge, offering advantages like high temporal resolution, high dynamic range and low latency, which motivate us to explore their potential to perform motion tracking in limited scenarios. In this paper, we propose FlyTracker, aiming at developing visual sensing ability for drones of both individual and circumambient location-relevant contextual, by using a monocular event camera. In FlyTracker, background-subtraction-based method is proposed to distinguish moving objects from background and fusion-based photometric features are carefully designed to obtain motion information. Through multilevel fusion of events and images, which are heterogeneous visual data, FlyTracker can effectively and reliably track the 6-DoF pose of the drone as well as monitor relative positions of moving obstacles.

To mitigate the system heterogeneity issues of FL and overcome the resource constraints of clients, we investigate a novel paradigm in which heterogeneous clients learn uniquely designed models with different architectures, and transfer knowledge to the server to train a larger server model that in turn helps to enhance client models. For efficient knowledge transfer between client models and server model, we propose FedHKT, a Hierarchical Knowledge Transfer framework for FL. The main idea of FedHKT is to allow clients with similar data distributions to collaboratively learn to specialize in certain classes, then the specialized knowledge of clients is aggregated to a super knowledge covering all specialties to train the server model, and finally the server model knowledge is distilled to client models. Specifically, we tailor a hybrid knowledge transfer mechanism for FedHKT, where the model parameters based and knowledge distillation (KD) based methods are respectively used for client-edge and edge-cloud knowledge transfer, which can harness the pros and evade the cons of these two approaches in learning performance and resource efficiency. Besides, to efficiently aggregate knowledge for conducive server model training, we propose a weighted ensemble distillation scheme with server-assisted knowledge selection, which aggregates knowledge by its prediction confidence, selects qualified knowledge during server model training, and uses selected knowledge to help improve client models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FedHKT compared to state-of-the-art baselines.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:33","2023-09-19 10:38:33","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we propose a new form of D-KFAC with a reduce-based alternative to eliminate redundant communications. This poses new challenges and opportunities in that the reduce collective requires a root worker to collect the results, which considerably complicates the communication scheduling. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem that determines tensor fusion and tensor placement simultaneously aiming to minimize the training iteration time. We develop novel communication scheduling strategies and propose a placement-aware D-KFAC (PAD-KFAC) training algorithm, which further improves communication efficiency.

However, the high computational and communication overheads hinder the adoption of VFL in many resource-limited or delay-sensitive applications. In this work, we focus on reducing the communication cost and delay incurred by the transmission of intermediate results in VFL model serving. We investigate the inference results, and find that a large portion of test samples can be predicted correctly by the active party alone, thus the corresponding communication for federated inference is dispensable. Based on this insight, we theoretically analyze the ""dispensable communication"" and propose a novel tunable vertical federated learning framework, named TVFL, to avoid ""dispensable communication"" in model serving as much as possible. TVFL can smartly switch between independent inference and federated inference based on the features of the input sample. We further reveal that such tunability is highly related to the importance of participants’ features.

Nevertheless, these attacks either require modification of the FL model (analytics-based) or take a long time to converge (optimization-based) and fail in dealing with highly compressed gradients in practical FL systems. In this paper, we pioneer a generation-based GLA method called FGLA that can reconstruct batches of user data, forgoing the optimization process. Specifically, we design a feature separation technique that extracts the feature of each data in a batch and then generates user data directly. Extensive experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate that FGLA can reconstruct user images in milliseconds with a batch size of 256 from highly compressed gradients (0.8% compression ratio or higher), thus substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:47","2023-09-19 10:38:47","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in edge networks (e.g., 5G), the number of user devices sharing a bottleneck link far exceeds the number of queues supported by today’s switch hardware; even accurately tracking per-user sending rates may become too resource-intensive. Meanwhile, traditional software-based queuing on CPUs struggles to meet the high throughput and low latency demanded by 5G users.We propose Approximate Hierarchical Allocation of Bandwidth (AHAB), a per-user bandwidth limit enforcer that runs fully in the data plane of commodity switches. AHAB tracks each user’s approximate traffic rate and compares it against a bandwidth limit, which is iteratively updated via a real-time feedback loop to achieve max-min fairness across users. Using a novel sketch data structure, AHAB avoids storing per-user state, and therefore scales to thousands of slices and millions of users. Furthermore, AHAB supports network slicing, where each slice has a guaranteed share of the bandwidth that can be scavenged by other slices when under-utilized. Evaluation shows AHAB can achieve fair bandwidth allocation within 3.1ms, 13x faster than prior data-plane hierarchical schedulers.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:48","2023-09-19 10:38:48","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing gradient compression algorithms suffer from accuracy degradation in Non-IID scenarios, because a uniform compression scheme is used to compress gradients at workers with different data distributions and volumes, since workers with larger volumes of data are forced to adapt to the same aggressive compression ratios as others. Assigning different compression ratios to workers with different data distributions and volumes is thus a promising solution. In this study, we first derive a function from capturing the correlation between the number of training iterations for a model to converge to the same accuracy, and the compression ratios at different workers; This function particularly shows that workers with larger data volumes should be assigned with higher compression ratios1 to guarantee better accuracy. Then, we formulate the assignment of compression ratios to the workers as an n-variables chi-square nonlinear optimization problem under fixed and limited total communication constrain. We propose an adaptive gradient compression strategy called DAGC, which assigns each worker a different compression ratio according to their data volumes.

In many applications of ML (e.g., image classification), the labels of training data need to be generated manually by human agents (e.g., recognizing and annotating objects in an image), which are usually costly and error-prone. In this paper, we study FL with crowdsourced data labeling where the local data of each participating client of FL are labeled manually by the client. We consider the strategic behavior of clients who may not make desired effort in their local data labeling and local model computation (quantified by the mini-batch size used in the stochastic gradient computation), and may misreport their local models to the FL server. We first characterize the performance bounds on the training loss as a function of clients' data labeling effort, local computation effort, and reported local models, which reveal the impacts of these factors on the training loss. With these insights, we devise Labeling and Computation Effort and local Model Elicitation (LCEME) mechanisms which incentivize strategic clients to make truthful efforts as desired by the server in local data labeling and local model computation, and also report true local models to the server. The truthful design of the LCEME mechanism exploits the non-trivial dependence of the training loss on clients' hidden efforts and private local models, and overcomes the intricate coupling in the joint elicitation of clients' efforts and local models. Under the LCEME mechanism, we characterize the server’s optimal local computation effort assignments and analyze their performance. We evaluate the proposed FL algorithms with crowdsourced data labeling and the LCEME mechanism for the MNIST-based hand-written digit classification.

FL suffers from significant performance degradation due to the excessive communication delay between the server and devices, especially when the network bandwidth of these devices is limited, which is common in edge environments. Existing methods overlap the gradient computation and communication to hide the communication latency to accelerate the FL training. However, the overlapping can also lead to an inevitable gap between the local model in each device and the global model in the server that seriously restricts the convergence rate of learning process. To address this problem, we propose a new overlapping method for FL, AOCC-FL, which aligns the local model with the global model via calibrated compensation such that the communication delay can be hidden without deteriorating the convergence performance. Theoretically, we prove that AOCC-FL admits the same convergence rate as the non-overlapping method.

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel key generation system for LoRa networks, named ChirpKey. We reveal that the underlying limitations are coarse-grained channel measurement and inefficient quantization process. To enable fine-grained channel information, we propose a novel LoRa-specific channel measurement method that essentially analyzes the chirp-level changes in LoRa packets.

The blockchain oracle problem arises around the need to procure trustworthy data from external sources. Previous works have addressed data authenticity/integrity by building a secure channel between blockchain and external sources while employing a decentralized oracle network to avoid a single point of failure. However, the truthful data challenge, which emerges when legitimate external sources submit fraudulent or deceitful data, remains unsolved. In this paper, we introduce a new decentralized truth-discovering oracle architecture called DecenTruth to address the truthful data challenge using a data-centric approach. DecenTruth aims to elevate the ""truthfulness"" of external data input by enabling decentralized oracle nodes to discover and reach consensus on truthful values of common data objects from multi-sourced inputs in an off-chain manner. It harmonizes techniques in both the data plane and consensus plane—truth discovery (TD) and asynchronous BFT consensus—and enables nodes to finalize the same estimated truths on data objects with high accuracy, amid the harsh asynchronous network condition and presence of Byzantine sources and nodes. We implemented DecenTruth and evaluated its performance in a simulated oracle service scenario. The results demonstrate significantly higher Byzantine resilience and long-term data feed accuracy of DecenTruth, compared to existing median-based aggregation methods.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:51","2023-09-19 10:38:51","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reduce the amount of communication, the devices send quantized and compressed local decisions to the server, resulting in noisy global decisions. Therefore, there exists a tradeoff between the optimization performance and the communication overhead. Existing works separately optimize computation and communication. In contrast, we jointly consider computation and communication over time, by encouraging temporal similarity in the decision sequence to control the communication overhead. We propose an efficient algorithm, termed Online Distributed Optimization with Temporal Similarity (ODOTS), where the local decisions are both computation- and communication-aware. Furthermore, ODOTS uses a novel tunable virtual queue, which completely removes the commonly assumed Slater’s condition through a modified Lyapunov drift analysis.

However, to work with the limited computation and communication capabilities of edge networks, a major challenge in developing decentralized bilevel optimization techniques is to lower sample and communication complexities. This motivates us to develop a new decentralized bilevel optimization called DIAMOND (decentralized single-timescale stochastic approximation with momentum and gradient-tracking). The contributions of this paper are as follows: i) our DIAMOND algorithm adopts a single-loop structure rather than following the natural double-loop structure of bilevel optimization, which offers low computation and implementation complexity; ii) compared to existing approaches, the DIAMOND algorithm does not require any full gradient evaluations, which further reduces both sample and computational complexities; iii) through a careful integration of momentum information and gradient tracking techniques, we show that the DIAMOND algorithm enjoys $\mathcal{O}\left( {{ \in ^{ - 3/2}}} \right)$ in sample and communication complexities for achieving an ϵ-stationary solution, both of which are independent of the dataset sizes and significantly outperform existing works.

Thus, once attackers replay a secretly-recorded voice command by loudspeakers to compromise users’ voice assistants, this operation will cause serious consequences, such as information leakage and property loss. Unfortunately, most voice liveness detection approaches against replay attacks mainly rely on detecting lip motions or subtle physiological features in speech, which are limited within a very short range. In this paper, we propose VoShield to check whether a voice command is from a genuine user or a loudspeaker imposter. VoShield measures sound field dynamics, a feature that changes fast as the human mouths dynamically open and close. In contrast, it would remain rather stable for loudspeakers due to the fixed size. This feature enables VoShield to largely extend the working distance and remain resilient to user locations. Besides, sound field dynamics are extracted from the difference between multiple microphone channels, making this feature robust to voice volume. To evaluate VoShield, we conducted comprehensive experiments with various settings in different working scenarios. The results show that VoShield can achieve a detection accuracy of 98.2% and an Equal Error Rate of 2.0%, which serves as a promising complement to current voice authentication systems for smart devices.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:53","2023-09-19 10:38:53","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, FL faces massive communication overhead resulted from uploading the gradients in each training round. To address this problem, most existing research compresses the gradients with fixed and unified quantization for all the clients, which neither seeks adaptive quantization due to the varying gradient norms at different rounds, nor exploits the heterogeneity of the clients to accelerate FL. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive and heterogeneous gradient quantization algorithm (AdaGQ) for FL to minimize the wall-clock training time from two aspects: i) adaptive quantization which exploits the change of gradient norm to adjust the quantization resolution in each training round; and ii) heterogeneous quantization which assigns lower quantization resolution to slow clients to align their training time with other clients to mitigate the communication bottleneck, and higher quantization resolution to fast clients to achieve a better communication efficiency and accuracy tradeoff. Evaluations based on various models and datasets validate the benefits of AdaGQ, reducing the total training time by up to 52.1% compared to baseline algorithms (e.g., FedAvg, QSGD).","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:53","2023-09-19 10:38:53","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the more general model, we show that our deterministic algorithm performs closely to optimum (it is 4-competitive).

However, we cast doubt upon the real impact of these gradient attacks on production federated learning systems. By taking away several impractical assumptions that the literature has made, we find that gradient attacks pose a limited degree of threat to the privacy of raw data.Through a comprehensive evaluation on existing gradient attacks in a federated learning system with practical assumptions, we have systematically analyzed their effectiveness under a wide range of configurations. We present key priors required to make the attack possible or stronger, such as a narrow distribution of initial model weights, as well as inversion at early stages of training. We then propose a new lightweight defense mechanism that provides sufficient and self-adaptive protection against time-varying levels of the privacy leakage risk throughout the federated learning process. As a variation of gradient perturbation method, our proposed defense, called Outpost, selectively adds Gaussian noise to gradients at each update iteration according to the Fisher information matrix, where the level of noise is determined by the privacy leakage risk quantified by the spread of model weights at each layer. To limit the computation overhead and training performance degradation, Outpost only performs perturbation with iteration-based decay. Our experimental results demonstrate that Outpost can achieve a much better tradeoff than the state-of-the-art with respect to convergence performance, computational overhead, and protection against gradient attacks.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:54","2023-09-19 10:38:54","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the BLE operates in the crowded 2.4GHz frequency band, which can lead to a high packet loss rate. Second, it is common for one device to connect with multiple BLE Peripherals, which can lead to severe collision issue. Third, there is a long delay to re-allocate time resource.

We first formulate the BLE transmission latency in noisy RF environments considering the BLE retransmission mechanism. With this, RT-BLE can get a set of initial connection parameters. Then, RT-BLE uses collision tree based time resource scheduling technology to efficiently manage time resource. Finally, we propose a subrating-based fast connection re-scheduling method to update the connection parameters and the position of anchor points. The result shows RT-BLE can provide reliable service and the error of our model is less than 0.69%.

In particular, with the rapid deployment of satellite networks in recent years, an efficient MDDT solver will serve as a key building block there.The MDDT problem can be solved in polynomial time by finding the maximum flow in a time-expanded graph. A binary-search-based solver incurs O(N•log N•Γ) time complexity, where N corresponds to time horizon and Γ is the time complexity to solve a maximum flow problem for one snapshot of the network. In this work, we design a one-pass solver that progressively expands the graph over time until it reaches the earliest time interval n to complete the delivery. By reusing the calculated maximum flow results from earlier iterations, it solves the MDDT problem while incurring only O(nΓ) time complexity for algorithms that can apply our technique. We apply the one-pass design to Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and evaluate our solver using a network of 184 satellites from Starlink constellations.

Previous works on minimum delay routing rely on knowledge of the delay function that maps the routing policies to their corresponding average delay, which is typically unavailable in stochastic queueing networks due to the complex dependency of the delay function on the distributional characteristics of network links. In this paper, we propose a learning approach to the minimum delay routing problem, whereby instead of relying on aprior information on the delay function, we seek to learn the delay function through observations. We design an algorithm that leverages finite-time observations of network queue lengths to approximate the values of the delay function, uses the approximate values to estimate the gradient of the delay function, and performs gradient descent based on the estimated gradient to optimize the routing policy. We prove that our algorithm converges to the optimal static routing policy when the delay function is convex, which is a reasonable condition in practical settings. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm, demonstrating its superior delay performance over static policies and even dynamic policies such as Join-the-Shortest-Queue and BackPressure.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:56","2023-09-19 10:38:56","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this problem, the gradient compression methods based on compressed sensing (CS) theory have been put forward recently. However, most existing CS-based works compress gradients independently, ignoring the gradient correlations between participants or adjacent communication rounds, which constrains the achievement of higher compression rates. In view of the above observation, we propose a novel gradient compression scheme named FedDCS, guided by distributed compressed sensing (DCS) theory. Following the design philosophy of separate encoding and joint decoding in DCS, FedDCS compresses gradients for participants in each round separately while reconstructing them at the central server jointly via fully exploiting correlated gradients from the previous round, which are known as side information (SI). Benefiting from this design, reconstruction performance is significantly improved with fewer decoding errors also iterations under the identical compression rate, and the total uploading bits to achieve model convergence are considerably reduced.

Specifically, mRotate separates the target signal reflected by the rotating object from the mixed reflection signals, extracts the high-quality rotation related features, and accurately obtains the rotation speed through the customized radar sensing mode and algorithm design. We implement mRotate on a commercial mmWave radar and extensively evaluate it in both lab environments and in a machining workshop for field tests. mRotate achieves an MAPE of 0.24% in accuracy test, which is 38% lower than that produced by the baseline device, a popular commercial laser tachometer.

They are also beneficial in resisting emerging active attacks, which aim at maliciously controlling mobile devices, e.g., smartphones and tablets. With touchscreen-like HMIs, users can notice and interrupt malicious actions conducted by the attackers timely and perform necessary countermeasures, e.g., tapping the ‘Quit’ button on the touchscreen. However, the effect of HMI-oriented active attacks has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we present a practical attack towards touch-based devices, namely Expelliarmus. It reveals a new attack surface of active attacks for hijacking users’ operations and thus taking full control over victim devices. Expelliarmus neutralizes users’ touch commands by producing a reverse current via electromagnetic interference (EMI). Since the reverse current offsets the current change caused by a touch, the touchscreen detects no current change and thus ignores users’ commands. Besides this basic denial-of-service attack, we also realize a target cancellation attack, which can neutralize target commands, e.g., ‘Quit’ without interference in irrelevant operations. Thus, the active attack can be completely performed without interruption from users, even if they are alerted by the abnormal events.

Although the offloading effort has led to greater performance, it brings difficulty in the verification of timing-related network functions (Time-NFs) as well. Time-NFs use numerical timing values to perform various network tasks. For example, congestion control algorithm BBR uses round-trip time to improve throughput. Errors in Time-NFs could cause packet loss and poor throughput. However, verifying Time-NFs in HW often involves many clock cycles that can result in an exponentially increasing number of test cases. Current verification methods either do not scale or sacrifice soundness for scalability.In this paper, we propose an invariant-based method to improve the verification efficiency without losing soundness. Our method is motivated by an observation that most Time-NFs follow a few fixed patterns to use timing information. Based on these patterns, we develop a set of easy-to-validate invariants to constrain the examination space. According to experiments on real Time-NFs, our method can speed up verification by 7 times on average without losing the verification soundness.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:38:59","2023-09-19 10:38:59","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the existing works fail to address all these practical concerns in FL: limited communication resources, dynamic network conditions and heterogeneous client properties, which slow down the convergence of FL. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a heterogeneity-aware FL framework, called FedCG, with adaptive client selection and gradient compression. Specifically, the parameter server (PS) selects a representative client subset considering statistical heterogeneity and sends the global model to them. After local training, these selected clients upload compressed model updates matching their capabilities to the PS for aggregation, which significantly alleviates the communication load and mitigates the straggler effect. We theoretically analyze the impact of both client selection and gradient compression on convergence performance. Guided by the derived convergence rate, we develop an iteration-based algorithm to jointly optimize client selection and compression ratio decision using submodular maximization and linear programming. Extensive experiments on both real-world prototypes and simulations show that FedCG can provide up to 5.3× speedup compared to other methods.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:00","2023-09-19 10:39:00","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These datacenters rely on optical switches which can be reconfigured to provide direct connectivity between racks, in the form of edge-disjoint matchings. While state-of-the-art optical switches in principle support microsecond reconfigurations, the demand-aware topology optimization constitutes a bottleneck.This paper proposes a dynamic algorithms approach to improve the performance of reconfigurable datacenter networks, by supporting faster reactions to changes in the traffic demand. This approach leverages the temporal locality of traffic patterns in order to update the interconnecting matchings incrementally, rather than recomputing them from scratch. In particular, we present six (batch-)dynamic algorithms and compare them to static ones. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on 176 synthetic and 39 real-world traces, and find that dynamic algorithms can both significantly improve the running time and reduce the number of changes to the configuration, especially in networks with high temporal locality, while retaining matching weight.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:00","2023-09-19 10:39:00","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HyperLogLog (HLL) has become a standard in practice because it offers good memory efficiency, constant update time, and mergeability. Some recent work achieved better memory efficiency, but typically at the cost of impractical update time or losing mergeability, making them incompatible with applications like network-wide traffic measurement. This work presents SpikeSketch, a better cardinality estimator that reduces memory usage of HLL by 37% without sacrificing other crucial metrics. We adopt a bucket-based data structure to promise constant update time, design a smoothed log4 ranking and a spike coding scheme to compress cardinality observables into buckets, and propose a lightweight mergeable lossy compression to balance memory usage, information loss, and mergeability. Then we derive an unbiased estimator for recovering cardinality from the lossy-compressed sketch. Theoretical and empirical results show that SpikeSketch can work as a drop-in replacement for HLL because it achieves a near-optimal MVP (memory-variance-product) of 4.08 (37% smaller than HLL) with constant update time and mergeability.

Lacking switch memory management leads to inefficient cluster resource usage. We build INAlloc, a switch memory management system for DT job schedulers to improve INA-empowered DT jobs in shared clusters. INAlloc adds a switch memory management layer to organize the physical switch memory, allocate memory to jobs, and provide friendly interfaces to schedulers. INAlloc incorporates switch memory into modeling a job's completion time (JCT) and its resources, which assists the scheduler in deciding the switch memory allocation.

This paper proposes Contrastive Learning with Self-Reconstruction called CLSR-AMC to learn good representations of signals resilient to channel changes. While contrastive loss focuses on the differences between individual modulations, the reconstruction loss captures representative features of the signal. Additionally, we develop three data augmentation operators to emulate the impact of channel and hardware impairments without exhaustive modeling of different channel profiles. We perform extensive experimentation with commonly used realistic datasets.

Nonetheless, the memory cost couples the actions over time, adding substantial challenges. Conventionally, this problem has been approached by various expert-designed online algorithms with the goal of achieving bounded worst-case competitive ratios, but the resulting average performance is often unsatisfactory. On the other hand, emerging machine learning (ML) based optimizers can improve the average performance, but suffer from the lack of worst-case performance robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel expert-robustified learning (ERL) approach, achieving both good average performance and robustness. More concretely, for robustness, ERL introduces a novel projection operator that robustifies ML actions by utilizing an expert online algorithm; for average performance, ERL trains the ML optimizer based on a recurrent architecture by explicitly considering downstream expert robustification. We prove that, for any λ ≥ 1, ERL can achieve λ-competitive against the expert algorithm and λ•C-competitive against the optimal offline algorithm (where C is the expert’s competitive ratio). Additionally, we extend our analysis to a novel setting of multi-step memory costs.

However, when applied to wireless network scenarios, FL usually suffers from high communication cost because clients need to transmit their updated gradients to a server in every training round. Although many gradient compression techniques like sparsification and quantization are proposed, they compress clients’ gradients independently, without considering the correlations among gradients. In this paper, we propose SVDFed, a collaborative gradient compression framework for FL. SVDFed utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to find a few basis vectors, whose linear combination can well represent clients’ gradients at a certain round. Due to the correlations among gradients, these basis vectors can still well approximate new gradients in many subsequent rounds. With the help of basis vectors, clients only need to upload the coefficients of the linear combination to the server, which greatly reduces communication cost. In addition, SVDFed leverages the classical PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) control to determine the proper time to update basis vectors to maintain their representation ability. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SVDFed outperforms existing gradient compression methods in FL. For example, compared to a popular gradient quantization method QSGD, SVDFed can reduce the communication overhead by 66 % and pending time by 99 %.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:02","2023-09-19 10:39:02","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, we model the incentive mechanism design with AoI guarantees as a novel incomplete information two-stage Stackelberg game with multiple constraints. Next, we derive the optimal strategies of this game so as to determine the optimal reward paid by the platform and the optimal data update frequency for each worker. Moreover, we prove that these optimal strategies form a unique Stackelberg equilibrium. Based on the optimal strategies, we propose an AoI-Aware Incentive (AIAI) mechanism for the MCS system, whereby the platform and all workers can maximize their utilities simultaneously.

Therefore, solving the distributed optimization problem has become an important task. In this work, we consider a distributed processing network $G = \left( {\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}} \right)$ with n nodes, where each node i can only evaluate the values of a local function (i.e., has zeroth-order information) and can only communicate with its neighbors. The objective is to reach consensus on the global optimizer of ${\max _{x \in \mathcal{X}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^n {{f_i}(x)} $. Previous methods either assume first-order gradient information which is not suitable for many model-free learning scenarios, or consider the zeroth-order information but assume convexity of the objective functions and can only guarantee convergence to a stationary point for nonconvex objectives. To address these limitations, we drop both the known gradient assumption and convexity assumption. Instead, we propose a distributed Bayesian framework for the problem with only zeroth-order information and general nonconvex objective functions in a Matérn Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Under this framework, we propose an algorithm and show that with high probability it reaches consensus on all nodes and has a sublinear regret with regard to the global optimal.

To protect against such attacks, security researchers proposed different solutions to verify the identity of a USB device via side-channel information (e.g., timing or electromagnetic emission). However, such solutions often make strong assumptions on the measurement (e.g., electromagnetic interference-free area around the device), on a device’s state (e.g., only at the boot or during specific actions), or are limited to one particular type of USB device (e.g., flash drive or input devices).In this paper, we present PowerID, a novel method to fingerprint USB peripherals based on their power consumption.

Although MIA has been widely studied for discriminative models, for generative models, neither it nor its defense is extensively investigated. In this work, we propose a mixup training method for generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a defense against MIAs. Specifically, the original training data is replaced with their interpolations so that GANs would never overfit the original data. The intriguing part is an analysis from the hypothesis test perspective to theoretically prove our method could mitigate the AUC of the strongest likelihood ratio attack.

Such explorations mainly limit their studies to static network topology or simplified dynamic networks, toward the social trust relationship prediction. In contrast, in this paper, we explore the social trust by taking into account the time-varying online social networks whereas the social trust relationship may vary over time. The DTrust, a dynamic graph neural network-based solution, will be proposed for accurate social trust prediction. In particular, DTrust is composed of a static aggregation unit and a dynamic unit, respectively responsible for capturing both the spatial dependence features and temporal dependence features. In the former unit, we stack multiple NNConv layers derived from the edge-conditioned convolution network for capturing the spatial dependence features correlated to the network topology and the observed social relationships. In the latter unit, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed for learning the evolution law of social interaction and social trust relationships. Based on the extracted spatial and temporal features, we then employ a fully connected neural network for learning, able to predict the social trust relationships for both current and future time slots.

To tackle this challenge, IPv6 scan generally leverages pre-defined seed addresses to guide search directions. Under this general principle, however, the core problem of effectively using the seeds is largely open. In this work, we propose a novel IPv6 active search strategy, namely HMap6, which significantly improves the use of seeds, w.r.t. the marginal benefit, for large-scale active address discovery in various prefixes. Using a heuristic search strategy for efficient seed collection and alias prefix detection under a wide range of BGP prefixes, HMap6 can greatly expand the scan coverage. Real-world experiments over the Internet in billion-scale scans show that HMap6 can discover 29.39M unique /80 prefixes with active addresses, an 11.88% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the IPv6 hitlists from HMap6 include all-responsive IPv6 addresses with rich information. This result sharply differs from existing public IPv6 hitlists, which contain non-responsive and filtered addresses, and pushes the IPv6 hitlists from quantity to quality.

However, SS-based MPC protocol introduces significant communication overhead due to interactive operations on secret sharings over the network. For instance, training a neural network model with SS-based MPC may incur tens of thousands of communication rounds among parties, making it extremely hard for real-world deployment.To reduce the communication overhead of SS, prior works statically convert interactive operations to equivalent non-interactive operations with extra computation cost. However, we show that such static conversion misses chances for optimization, and further present SOLAR, an SS-based MPC framework that aims to reduce the communication overhead through dynamic communication-computation conversion. At its heart, SOLAR converts interactive operations that involve communication among parties to equivalent non-interactive operations within each party with extra computations and introduces a speculative strategy to perform opportunistic conversion when CPU is idle for network transmission. We have implemented and evaluated SOLAR on several popular MPC applications, and achieved 1.6-8.1 times speedup in multi-thread setting compared to the basic SS and 1.2-8.6 times speedup over static conversion.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:05","2023-09-19 10:39:05","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies show that the missing data can be inferred from partial measurements using neural network models and tensor methods. However, these recovery approaches fail to achieve accuracy, adaptability and high speed, simultaneously. In this paper, we propose RecMon, a deep learning-based data recovery system that satisfies the above three criteria. A global spatio-temporal attention mechanism and a data augmentation algorithm are proposed to improve the recovery accuracy. A semi-supervised learning-based scheme is devised for fast and effective model updates. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to compare RecMon with four state-of-the-art methods in terms of online recovery performance. The experimental results show that RecMon can adapt to the latest state of the network and accurately recover network measurement data in less than 100 milliseconds.

Several Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been designed to capture the complex spatio-temporal characteristics of mobile traffic patterns at scale. These models are complex black boxes whose decisions are inherently hard to explain. Even worse, they have proven vulnerable to adversarial attacks which undermine their applicability in production networks. In this paper, we conduct a first in-depth study of the vulnerabilities of DNNs for large-scale mobile traffic forecasting. We propose DeExp, a new tool that leverages EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to understand which Base Stations (BSs) are more influential for forecasting from a spatio-temporal perspective. This is challenging as existing XAI techniques are usually applied to computer vision or natural language processing and need to be adapted to the mobile network context. Upon identifying the more influential BSs, we run state-of-the art Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) techniques on those BSs and measure the accuracy degradation of the predictors.

It not only reduces people’s work efficiency, but also causes health and safety related problems. The existing fatigue detection systems either have different shortcomings in diverse scenarios or are limited by proprietary equipment, which is difficult to be applied in real life. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-information fatigue detection system named WakeUp based on commercial smart speakers, which is the first to fuse physiological and behavioral information for fine-grained fatigue detection in a non-contact manner. We carefully design a method to simultaneously extract users’ physiological and behavioral information based on the MobileViT network and VMD decomposition algorithm respectively. Then, we design a multi-information fusion method based on the statistical features of these two kinds of information. In addition, we adopt an SVM classifier to achieve fine-grained fatigue level.

It is promising to use serverless computing for compressing data to save the transmission data amount. However, it is challenging to estimate the data transmission time and monetary cost with serverless compression. In addition, minimizing the data transmission cost is non-trivial due to enormous parameter space and joint optimization. This paper focuses on this problem and makes the following contributions: (1) We propose empirical data transmission time and monetary cost models based on serverless compression. (2) For single-task cloud data transmission, we propose two efficient parameter search methods based on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP ) and Eliminate then Divide and Conquer (EDC), which are theoretically proven with error upper bounds. (3) Furthermore, for multi-task cloud data transmission, a parameter search method based on dynamic programming and numerical computation is proposed to reduce the algorithm complexity from exponential to linear complexity. We have implemented the entire actual system and evaluated it with various workloads and application cases on the real-world AWS serverless computing platform. Experimental results on cross-region public cloud show that the proposed approach can improve the parameter search efficiency by more than 3× compared with the state-of-art parameter search methods and achieves better parameter quality.

As such FL systems are exposed to, or indeed the cause of, congestion across a wide set of network resources. Lossy compression can be used to reduce the size of exchanged files and associated delays, at the cost of adding noise to model updates. By judiciously adapting clients’ compression to varying network congestion, an FL application can reduce wall clock training time. To that end, we propose a Network Adaptive Compression (NAC-FL) policy, which dynamically varies the client’s lossy compression choices to network congestion variations. We prove, under appropriate assumptions, that NAC-FL is asymptotically optimal in terms of directly minimizing the expected wall clock training time. Further, we show via simulation that NAC-FL achieves robust performance improvements with higher gains in settings with positively correlated delays across time.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:08","2023-09-19 10:39:08","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential, existing works are either limited by fixed models or require enormous data/time for online adaptation, which struggle to fit time-varying and diverse network states. Driven by these practical concerns, we perform large-scale measurements on WeChat for Business’s interactive video service to study real-world network fluctuations. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that, compared to time-varying network metrics, network sequences exhibit noticeable short-term continuity, sufficient for few-shot learning requirement. We thus propose Fiammetta, the first meta-RL-based bitrate adaptation algorithm for interactive video streaming. Building on the short-term continuity, Fiammetta accumulates learning experiences through offline meta-training and enables fast online adaptation to changing network states through few gradient updates. Moreover, Fiammetta innovatively incorporates a probing mechanism for real-time monitoring of network states, and proposes an adaptive meta-testing mechanism for seamless adaptation. We implement Fiammetta on a testbed whose end-to-end network follows the real-world WeChat for Business traces.

In this paper, we propose SplitGP, a new split learning solution that can simultaneously capture generalization and personalization capabilities for efficient inference across resource-constrained clients (e.g., mobile/IoT devices). Our key idea is to split the full ML model into client-side and server-side components, and impose different roles to them: the client-side model is trained to have strong personalization capability optimized to each client’s main task, while the server-side model is trained to have strong generalization capability for handling all clients’ out-of-distribution tasks. We analytically characterize the convergence behavior of SplitGP, revealing that all client models approach stationary points asymptotically.

Model partitioning, as a promising approach, splits CNNs and distributes them to multiple edge devices in closer proximity to each other for serial inferences, however, it causes considerable cross-edge delay for transmitting intermediate feature maps. To overcome this challenge, we present ResMap, a new edge video analytics framework that significantly improves the cross-edge transmission and flexibly partitions the CNNs. Briefly, by exploiting the sparsity of the intermediate raw or residual feature map, ResMap effectively removes the redundant transmission, thereby decreasing the cross-edge transmission delay. In addition, ResMap incorporates an Online Data-Aware Scheduler to regularly update the CNN partitioning scheme so as to adapt to the time-varying edge runtime and video content. We have implemented ResMap fully based on COTS hardware, and the experimental results show that ResMap reduces the intermediate feature map volume by 14.93-46.12% and improves the average processing time by 17.43-30.6% compared to other alternative designs.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:12","2023-09-19 10:39:12","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper focuses on the technical and economic challenges that emerge from the application of the network slicing architecture to real-world scenarios. We consider a market where multiple Network Providers (NPs) own the physical infrastructure and offer their resources to multiple Service Providers (SPs). Then, the SPs offer those resources as slices to their associated users. We propose a holistic iterative model for the network slicing market along with a clock auction that converges to a robust ϵ-competitive equilibrium. At the end of each cycle of the market, the slices are reconfigured and the SPs aim to learn the private parameters of their users.

Therefore, a cache preserving popular results to support approximate match for similar input requests can accelerate the task by avoiding the otherwise expensive deep learning model inferences. However, the current software and hardware practices carried on edge or cloud servers are inefficient in either cost or performance. Taking advantage of the on-path programmable switches, we propose In-Switch Approximate Cache (ISAC) to reduce the server workload and latency. The unique approximate matching requirement sets ISAC apart from a conventional exact-match cache. Equipped with efficient encoding and qualifying algorithms, ISAC in an on-path switch can fulfill most of the input requests with high accuracy. When adapting to a P4 programmable switch, it can sustain up to 194M frames per second and fulfill 60.3% of them, achieving a considerable reduction on detection latency, server cost, and power consumption.

The popularity of motion sensors in earphones has fueled a rise in their sampling rate, which enables various enhanced features. This paper investigates a new threat of eavesdropping via motion sensors of earphones by developing EarSpy, which builds on our observation that the earphone’s accelerometer can capture bone conduction vibrations (BCVs) and ear canal dynamic motions (ECDMs) associated with speaking; they enable EarSpy to derive unique information about the wearer’s speech. Leveraging a study on the motion sensor measurements captured from earphones, EarSpy gains abilities to disentangle the wearer’s live speech from interference caused by body motions and vibrations generated when the earphone’s speaker plays audio. To enable user-independent attacks, EarSpy involves novel efforts, including a trajectory instability reduction method to calibrate the waveform of ECDMs and a data augmentation method to enrich the diversity of BCVs. Moreover, EarSpy explores effective representations from BCVs and ECDMs, and develops a convolutional neural model with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to realize accurate speech recognition. Extensive experiments involving 14 participants demonstrate that EarSpy reaches a promising recognition for the wearer’s speech.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:14","2023-09-19 10:39:14","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, streaming (downloading and processing) 360° video consumes a large amount of energy on mobile devices, but little work has been done to address this problem, especially considering recent advances in the mobile architecture. Through real measurements, we found that existing systems activate all processor cores during video streaming, which consumes a great deal of energy, but this is unnecessary since most heavy computations in 360° video processing are handled by the hardware accelerators such as hardware decoder, GPU, etc. To save energy, we propose to selectively activate the proper processor cluster and adaptively adjust the CPU frequency based on the video quality. We model the impacts of video resolution and CPU frequency on power consumption, and model the impacts of video features and network effects on Quality of Experience (QoE). With the developed models, we formulate the energy and QoE aware 360° video streaming problem as an optimization problem with the goal of maximizing QoE and minimizing energy. We then propose an efficient algorithm to solve this optimization problem. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the energy consumption while maintaining QoE.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:14","2023-09-19 10:39:14","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It examines traffic workloads by searching for specific rules. Since every byte of packets needs to be examined by many literal rules, multi-literal matching becomes the performance bottleneck of DPI. FDR, the fastest multi-literal matching engine on CPUs, takes advantage of Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) to alleviate this bottleneck and achieves a performance boost over the widely-used Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm. However, FDR does not deeply exploit the data-level parallelism of SIMD and its SIMD vector utilization is only 50%. Besides, limited by certain SIMD shift instructions, it cannot benefit from advanced SIMD instruction sets. To overcome these issues, we propose Harry, a scalable and SIMD-based multi-literal matching engine. Harry adopts a column-vector-based matching algorithm to improve the data-level parallelism and SIMD vector utilization. To support the algorithm, it takes two encoding methods to compress the mask table. Also, it utilizes shuffle instruction to implement shift. We implement Harry on commodity CPU and evaluate it with real network traffic and DPI rules. Our evaluation shows that Harry reaches a throughput of 30∼70Gbit/s, up to 52x that of AC and 2.09x of FDR. It has been successfully deployed in Hyperscan.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:15","2023-09-19 10:39:15","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, clients may sometimes be unavailable for training due to their network connections and energy levels. Considering the highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) degree of the clients’ datasets, the local models of the available clients being sampled for training may not represent those of all other clients. This is referred as system induced bias. In this work, we quantify the system induced bias due to time-varying client availability. The theoretical result shows that this bias occurs independently of the number of available clients and the number of clients being sampled in each training round. To address system induced bias, we propose a FedSS algorithm by incorporating stratified sampling and prove that the proposed algorithm is unbiased. We quantify the impact of system parameters on the algorithm performance and derive the performance guarantee of our proposed FedSS algorithm.

However, the resource contention between computation and All-Reduce communication in GPU-based training reduces the benefits of overlap. With GPU cluster network evolving from low bandwidth TCP to high speed networks, more GPU resources are required to efficiently utilize the bandwidth, making the contention more noticeable. Existing communication libraries fail to account for such contention when allocating GPU threads and have suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose to mitigate the contention by balancing the overlapped computation and communication time. We formulate an optimization problem that decides the communication thread allocation to reduce overall backward time. We develop a dynamic programming based near-optimal solution and extend it to co-optimize thread allocation with tensor fusion. We conduct simulated study and real-world experiment using an 8-node GPU cluster with 50Gb RDMA network training four representative DNN models.

The tenant task placement in geo-distributed clouds comes with three critical and coupled factors: regional diversity in electricity prices, access delay for tenants, and traffic demand among tasks. However, existing works disregard either the regional difference in electricity prices or the tenant requirements in geo-distributed clouds, resulting in increased operating costs or low user QoS. To bridge the gap, we design a cost optimization framework for tenant task placement in geo-distributed clouds, called TanGo. However, it is non-trivial to achieve an optimization framework while meeting all the tenant requirements. To this end, we first formulate the electricity cost minimization for task placement problem as a constrained mixed-integer non-linear programming problem.

The stability of the matching between buyers and sellers in the data trading market is one of the most important CDT issues. In this paper, we focus on the privacy-preserving stable CDT issue with unknown preference sequences of buyers. Our goal is to maximize the accumulative data quality for each task while protecting the data qualities of sellers and ensuring the stability of the CDT market. We model such privacy-preserving stable CDT issue with unknown preference sequences as a differentially private competing multi-player multi-armed bandit problem.

To resolve the tension between inference latency and resource cost, we present Polly, a cross-camera inference system that enables co-located cameras with different but overlapping fields of views (FoVs) to share inference results between one another, thus eliminating the redundant inference work for objects in the same physical area. Polly’s design solves two basic challenges of cross-camera inference: how to identify overlapping FoVs automatically, and how to share inference results accurately across cameras.

OmniSense achieves both low latency and high accuracy, combating the significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing 360° videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into 360° videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI) prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in 360° frames. Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and evaluate it on diverse real-world collected 360° videos.

The combination of high bandwidth, bursty traffic patterns, and shallow buffers imply that switch buffer is a heavily contended resource and intelligent management of shared buffers among competing traffic (ports, traffic classes) becomes an important challenge. Dynamic Threshold (DT), which is the current state-of-the-art in buffer management, provides either high bandwidth utilization with poor burst absorption or good burst absorption with inferior utilization, but not both. We present Protean, which dynamically identifies bursty traffic and allocates more buffer space accordingly—Protean provides more space to queues that experience transient load spikes by observing the gradient of queue length but does not cause persistent unfairness as the gradient cannot continue to remain high in shallow buffered switches for long periods of time. We implemented Protean in today’s programmable switches and demonstrate their high performance with negligible overhead.

However, as more traffic is protected with TLS, middleboxes are becoming unable to provide their functions. To leverage middlebox functionality while preserving communication security, secure middlebox channel protocols have been designed as extensions of TLS. A key idea is that the endpoints explicitly incorporate middleboxes into the TLS handshake and grant each middlebox either the read or the write permission for their messages. Because each middlebox has the least data access privilege, these protocols are resilient against the compromise of a single middlebox. However, the existing studies have not comprehensively analyzed the communication security under the scenarios where multiple middleboxes are compromised.

Due to the resource-limitation of ENs, the tasks often need to compete for the resources. Pricing mechanisms are widely used to deal with the resource allocation problem, and the valuations of tasks play a critical role in the price mechanisms. However, users naturally are not willing to expose the valuations of their tasks due to conflicts of interests. Current research works usually adopt truthful auctions to motivate the users to report honestly the valuations of their tasks. In this paper, we introduce the marginal value to estimate the valuations of tasks, and propose a marginal value-based pricing mechanism using the incentive theory, which motivates the tasks with higher marginal values to actively request more resources. The EC platform sets the resource prices using the price mechanism, and then the users determine their resource requests relying on the resource prices and the valuations of their tasks. After receiving the deadline-sensitive tasks from the users, the resource allocation can be modeled as a knapsack problem with the deadline constraints. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach is computationally efficient and is promising in enhancing the utility of the EC platform and the tasks.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:21","2023-09-19 10:39:21","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different from Video-on-Demand (VoD) or live streaming, MRVS enables all-to-all realtime video communication, bringing significant challenges to service providing. First, unreliable network transmission can cause network loss, resulting in delay increase and visual quality degradation. Second, the transformation from two-party to multi-party communication makes resource scheduling much more difficult. Moreover, optimizing the overall QoE requires a global coordination, which is quite challenging given the various impact factors such as bitrate and loss.In this paper, we propose the SJA framework, which is, to our best knowledge, the first server-driven joint loss and bitrate adaptation framework in multi-party realtime video streaming services towards maximized QoE. We comprehensively design an appropriate QoE model for MRVS services to capture the interplay among perceptual quality, variations, bitrate mismatch, loss damage, and streaming delay. We mathematically formulate the QoE maximization problem in MRVS services. A Lyapunov-based relaxation and the SJA algorithm are further designed to address the optimization problem with close-to-optimal performance.

Instead of pre-warming a complete container for a function, recent studies advocate Zygote container, which pre-imports some packages and is able to import the other dependent packages at runtime, so as to avoid the cold startup problem. However, as different functions have different package dependencies, how to plan the Zygote generation and pre-warming in a resource-capacitated edge cloud becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, aiming to minimize the overall function startup time and subjective to the resource capacity constraints, we formulate this problem into a Quadratic Integer Programming (QIP) form. We further propose a Randomized Rounding based Zygote Planning (RRZP) algorithm. The performance efficiency of our algorithm is proved via both theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulations. The results show that our algorithm can significantly reduce the startup time by 25.6%.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:23","2023-09-19 10:39:23","","1-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing 2FA solutions usually require some form of user involvement, which could severely affect user experience and bring extra burdens to users. In this work, we propose a secure 2FA that utilizes the individual acoustic fingerprint of the speaker/microphone on enrolled device as the second proof. The main idea behind our system is to use both magnitude and phase fingerprints derived from the frequency response of the enrolled device by emitting acoustic beep signals alternately from both enrolled and login devices and receiving their direct arrivals for 2FA. Given the input microphone samplings, our system designs an arrival time detection scheme to accurately identify the beginning point of the beep signal from the received signal. To achieve a robust authentication, we develop a new distance mitigation scheme to eliminate the impact of transmission distances from the sound propagation model for extracting stable fingerprint in both magnitude and phase domain. Our device authentication component then calculates a weighted correlation value between the device profile and fingerprints extracted from run-time measurements to conduct the device authentication for 2FA. Our experimental results show that our proposed system is accurate and robust to both random impersonation and Man-in-the-middle (MiM) attack across different scenarios and device models.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:23","2023-09-19 10:39:23","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Argosleep leverages deep learning models and knowledge of human anatomical features to solve challenges with low-resolution, specularity, and aliasing in existing mmWave devices. Argosleep builds the model by learning the relationship between mmWave reflected signals and body postures from thousands of existing samples. Since practical sleep also involves sudden toss-turns, which could introduce errors in posture prediction, Argosleep designs a state machine based on the reflected signals to classify the sleeping states into rest or toss-turn, and predict the posture only during the rest states. We evaluate Argosleep with real data collected from COTS mmWave devices for 8 volunteers of diverse ages, gender, and height performing different sleep postures. We observe that Argosleep identifies the toss-turn events accurately and predicts 3D location of body joints with accuracy on par with the existing vision-based system, unlocking the potential of mmWave systems for privacy-noninvasive at-home healthcare applications.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:24","2023-09-19 10:39:24","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the existing approaches primarily developed graph-based models for provenance tracking over monolithic applications running directly over the operating system kernel. In contrast, the modern DevOps-based service-oriented architecture relies on distributed platforms, like serverless computing that uses container-based sandboxing over the kernel. Provenance tracking over such a distributed micro-service architecture is challenging, as the application and system logs are generated asynchronously and follow heterogeneous nomenclature and logging formats. This paper develops a novel approach to combining system and micro-services logs together to generate a Universal Provenance Graph (UPG) that can be used for provenance tracking over serverless architecture. We develop a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) for runtime unit identification over the logs by intercepting the system calls with the help from the control flow graphs over the static application binaries. Finally, we design a regular expression-based log optimization method for reverse query parsing over the generated UPG. A thorough evaluation of the proposed UPG model with different benchmarked serverless applications shows the system’s effectiveness.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:24","2023-09-19 10:39:24","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we propose a CPU isolation scheme for NVMe over TCP in such an environment. The proposed scheme measures the CPU usage of the NVMe over TCP worker, charges it to containers in proportion to their NVMe traffic, and schedules containers to ensure isolated sharing of the CPU. However, because the worker runs with a higher priority than normal containers, it may not be possible to achieve CPU isolation with container scheduling alone. To solve this problem, we also control the CPU usage of the worker by throttling NVMe over TCP traffic. The proposed scheme is implemented on a real testbed for evaluation. We perform extensive experiments with various workloads and demonstrate that the scheme can provide CPU isolation even in the presence of excessive NVMe traffic.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:25","2023-09-19 10:39:25","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Answering this problem, which is known as the multiple source detection (MSD) problem, is critical whether for forensic use or insights to prevent future epidemics.Despite the recent considerable effort, most of them are built on a preset propagation model, which limits their application range. Some attempts aim to break this limitation via a label propagation scheme where the nodes surrounded by a large proportion of infected nodes are highlighted. Nonetheless, the detection accuracy may suffer since the node labels are simply integers with all infected or uninfected nodes sharing the same initialization setting respectively, which fall short of sufficiently distinguishing their structural properties. To this end, we propose a community based label propagation (CLP) framework that locates multiple sources through exploiting the community structures formed by infected subgraphs of different sources. Besides, CLP tries to enhance the detection accuracy by incorporating node prominence and exoneration effects, namely the nodes surrounded by larger proportions of infected nodes are more likely to be sources, and the uninfected nodes or infected ones in neighboring community hold the key in exonerating an infected node from being the source. As such, CLP is applicable in more propagation models, and is provably convergent. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks further validate the superiority of CLP to the state-of-the-art, boosting the F-score from few percents to approximately 68× in large-scale networks.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:25","2023-09-19 10:39:25","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, each DP-enhanced FL job accumulates privacy leakage, which necessitates a unified platform to enforce a global privacy budget for each dataset owned by users. In this work, we present a novel DP-enhanced FL platform that treats privacy as a resource and schedules multiple FL jobs across sensitive data. It first introduces a novel notion of device-time blocks for distributed data streams. Such data abstraction enables fine-grained privacy consumption composition across multiple FL jobs. Regarding the non-replenishable nature of the privacy resource (that differs it from traditional hardware resources like CPU and memory), it further employs an allocation-then-recycle scheduling algorithm. Its key idea is to first allocate an estimated upper-bound privacy budget for each arrived FL job, and then progressively recycle the unused budget as training goes on to serve further FL jobs.

To defend against such attacks, robust aggregation rules are designed for the centralized server to winnow out outlier updates, and to significantly reduce the effectiveness of existing poisoning attacks. In this paper, we develop an advanced model poisoning attack against defensive aggregation rules. In particular, we exploit the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon during the process of continual learning to destroy the memory of the global model. Our proposed framework, called Oblivion, features two special components. The first component prioritizes the weights that have the most influence on the model accuracy for poisoning, which induces a more significant degradation on the global model than equally perturbing all weights. The second component smooths malicious model updates based on the number of selected compromised clients in the current round, adjusting the degree of poisoning to suit the dynamics of each training round. We implement a fully-functional prototype of Oblivion in PLATO, a real-world scalable federated learning framework. Our extensive experiments over three datasets demonstrate that Oblivion can boost the attack performance of model poisoning attacks against unknown defensive aggregation rules.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:26","2023-09-19 10:39:26","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in many real-world scenarios, such as early prevention of epidemic, people are interested in not only the data at the current, but also in the future or even long-term future, and the latter may be more important. Long-term prediction not only reduces sensing cost, but also identifies trends or other characteristics of the data. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal model based on Transformer to infer and predict the data with sparse sensed data by utilizing spatiotemporal relationships. We design a spatiotemporal feature embedding to embed the prior spatiotemporal information of sensing map into the model to guide model learning. Moreover, we also design a novel multi-head spatiotemporal attention mechanism to dynamically capture spatiotemporal relationships among data.

With the presence of high input workload dynamics and intensive edge resource contention, it is highly non-trivial for an edge proxy to optimize the scheduling of heterogeneous services with diverse QoS requirements. In general, online services should be quickly completed in a quite stable running environment to meet their tight latency constraint, while offline services can be processed in a loose manner for their elastic soft deadlines. To well coordinate such services at the resource-limited edge cluster, in this paper, we study an edge-centric resource provisioning optimization for dynamic online and offline services co-location, where the proxy seeks to maximize timely online service performances while maintaining satisfactory long-term offline service performances. However, intricate hybrid couplings for provisioning decisions arise due to heterogeneous constraints of the co-located services and their different time-scale performances. We hence first propose a reactive provisioning approach without requiring a prior knowledge of future system dynamics, which leverages a Lagrange relaxation for devising constraint-aware stochastic subgradient algorithm to deal with the challenge of hybrid couplings. To further boost the performance by integrating the powerful machine learning techniques, we also advocate a predictive provisioning approach, where the future request arrivals can be estimated accurately.

As a result, there is a pressing need for a more efficient TSN scheduling algorithm. In this paper, we propose DeepScheduler, a fast and scalable flow-aware TSN scheduler based on deep reinforcement learning. In contrast to prior work that heavily relies on expert knowledge or problem-specific assumptions, DeepScheduler automatically learns effective scheduling policies from the complex dependency among data flows.

As a meta-heuristic algorithm, ACO-OSD performs better than the state-of-art heuristic algorithms, specifically 42.88% lower total cost on average.

Recent parallel CTC uses IEEE 802.11g to send emulated ZigBee signal and let the BLE receiver decodes its data from the emulated ZigBee signal with a dedicated codebook. It still has a low spectrum efficiency because IEEE 802.11g exclusively uses the whole channel. Besides, the codebook design hinders the reception on commodity BLE devices. In this paper, we propose WiCast, a parallel CTC that uses IEEE 802.11ax to emulate a composite signal that can be received by commodity BLE, ZigBee, and LoRa devices. By taking advantage of OFDMA in 802.11ax, WiCast uses a single Resource Unit (RU) for parallel CTC and sets other RUs free for high-rate WiFi users. But such a sophisticated composite signal is very easily distorted by emulation imperfections, dynamic channel noises, cyclic prefix, and center frequency offset. We propose a CTC link model that jointly models the emulation errors and channel distortions. Then we carve the emulated signal with elaborate compensations in both time and frequency domains to solve the above distortion problem.

This paper proposes TapFinger, a distributed scheduler that minimizes the total completion time of ML tasks in a multi-cluster edge network, through co-optimizing task placement and fine-grained multi-resource allocation. To learn the tasks' uncertain resource sensitivity and enable distributed online scheduling, we adopt multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and propose several techniques to make it efficient for our ML-task resource allocation. First, TapFinger uses a heterogeneous graph attention network as the MARL backbone to abstract inter-related state features into more learnable environmental patterns. Second, the actor network is augmented through a tailored task selection phase, which decomposes the actions and encodes the optimization constraints. Third, to mitigate decision conflicts among agents, we novelly combine Bayes' theorem and masking schemes to facilitate our MARL model training.

However, configuration updates typically involve multiple routers changing their configurations. Changes on these routers cannot be applied simultaneously. This leads to intermediate configurations, which might violate network properties such as reachability. Configuration updates synthesis aims to find an order of applying changes on routers such that network properties hold for all intermediate configurations.Existing approaches synthesize a safe update order by traversing the update order space, which is time-consuming and does not scale to a large number of configuration updates.

For a given EC request, quantum swapping along an EP is performed by a repeater whenever two adjacent ELs are created, so precious quantum resources at the repeater can be released immediately thereafter for other ELs and ECs. Extensive simulations show that AEPR can save up to 76.05% of the average task completion time in DQC systems compared with the state-of-the-art entanglement routing schemes designed to maximize QDN throughput.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:43","2023-09-19 10:39:43","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is particularly interesting for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies and above, due to the more challenging hardware design and channel environment at these frequencies. Rather than building individual ML-components, in this paper, we design an entire ML-enhanced mm-wave receiver for frequency selective channels. Our ML-receiver jointly optimizes the channel estimation, equalization, phase correction and demapper using Convolutional Neural Networks. We also show that for mm-wave systems, the channel varies significantly even over short timescales, requiring frequent channel measurements, and this situation is exacerbated in mobile scenarios. To tackle this, we propose a new ML-channel estimation approach that refreshes the channel state information using the guard intervals (not intended for channel measurements) that are available for every block of symbols in communication packets. To the best of our knowledge, our ML-receiver is the first work to outperform conventional receivers in general scenarios, with simulation results showing up to 7 dB gains. We also provide an experimental validation of the ML-enhanced receiver with a 60 GHz FPGA-based testbed with phased antenna arrays, which shows a throughput increase by a factor of up to 6 over baseline schemes in mobile scenarios.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:44","2023-09-19 10:39:44","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Past studies on network expansion while carrying live traffic have focused on packet-switched networks such as Ethernet. Optical networks have been attracting attention recently for datacenters due to their great transmission capacity and power efficiency, but they are modeled as circuit-switched networks. To our knowledge, no practical live expansion method is known for circuit-switched networks; the Clos network, a nonblocking three-stage switching structure, can be expanded, but it involves connection rearrangement (interruption) or significant initial investment. This paper proposes a cost-effective network expansion method without relying on connection rearrangement. Our method expands a network by rewiring inactive links to include additional switches, which also avoids the blocking of new connection requests. Our method is designed to only require switches whose number is proportional to the network size, which suppresses the initial investment. Numerical experiments show that our method incrementally expands a circuit-switched network from 1,000 to 30,000 ports, sufficient to accommodate all racks in a today’s huge datacenter. The initial structure of our method only consists of three 1024×1024 switches, while that of a reference method requires 34 switches.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:44","2023-09-19 10:39:44","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The platform will offer reward to incentivize users and compensate their costs incurred from information acquisition. In practice, the user cost (and its distribution) is hidden to the platform, thus it is challenging to determine the optimal reward. In this paper, we investigate how the platform dynamically rewards the users, aiming to jointly reduce the age of information (AoI) and the operational expenditure (OpEx). Due to the hidden cost distribution, this is an online non-convex learning problem with partial feedback. To overcome the challenge, we first design an age-based rewarding scheme, which decouples the OpEx from the unknown cost distribution and enables the platform to accurately control its OpEx. We then take advantage of the age-based rewarding scheme and propose an exponentially discretizing and learning (EDAL) policy for platform operation. We prove that the EDAL policy performs asymptotically as well as the optimal decision (derived based on the cost distribution). Simulation results show that the age-based rewarding scheme protects the platform’s OpEx from the influence of the user characteristics, and verify the asymptotic optimality of the EDAL policy.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:45","2023-09-19 10:39:45","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a cost-adjustable FL framework, named AnycostFL, that enables diverse edge devices to efficiently perform local updates under a wide range of efficiency constraints. To this end, we design the model shrinking to support local model training with elastic computation cost, and the gradient compression to allow parameter transmission with dynamic communication overhead. An enhanced parameter aggregation is conducted in an element-wise manner to improve the model performance. Focusing on AnycostFL, we further propose an optimization design to minimize the global training loss with personalized latency and energy constraints. By revealing the theoretical insights of the convergence analysis, personalized training strategies are deduced for different devices to match their locally available resources. Experiment results indicate that, when compared to the state-of-the-art efficient FL algorithms, our learning framework can reduce up to 1.9 times of the training latency and energy consumption for realizing a reasonable global testing accuracy.

One major challenge for TE is how to generate good routing strategies adaptive to highly dynamic future traffic scenarios. Unfortunately, existing works could either experience severe performance degradation under unexpected traffic fluctuations or sacrifice performance optimality for guaranteeing the worst-case performance when traffic is relatively stable. In this paper, we propose LARRI, a learning-based TE to predict adaptive routing strategies for future unknown traffic scenarios. By learning and predicting a routing to handle an appropriate range of future possible traffic matrices, LARRI can effectively realize a trade-off between performance optimality and worst-case performance guarantee. This is done by integrating the prediction of future demand range and the imitation of optimal range routing into one step. Moreover, LARRI employs a scalable graph neural network architecture to greatly facilitate training and inference. Extensive simulation results on six real-world network topologies and traffic traces show that LARRI achieves near-optimal load balancing performance in future traffic scenarios with up to 43.3% worst-case performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, and also provides the lowest end-to-end delay under dynamic traffic fluctuations.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:46","2023-09-19 10:39:46","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tasks across operators have various memory demands due to different processing logic (e.g., stateful vs. stateless tasks). The memory demands of tasks from the same operator could also vary and fluctuate due to workload variability. Improper memory provision will cause some tasks to have relatively high latency, or even unbound latency that can eventually lead to system instability. We found that the task with the maximum latency of an operator has a significant and even decisive impact on the end-to-end latency.In this paper, we present our task-level memory manager. Based on our quantitative modeling of memory and task-level latency, the manager can adaptively allocate optimal memory size to each task for minimizing the end-to-end latency.

On one hand, both signals are complex functions of the context, e.g., in federated learning, training loss (negative reward) and energy consumption (cost) are nonlinear functions of edge devices’ system conditions (context). On the other hand, there are cumulative constraints on costs, e.g., the accumulated energy consumption should be budgeted by energy resources. Besides, real-time systems often require such constraints to be guaranteed anytime or in each round, e.g., ensuring anytime fairness for task assignment to maintain the credibility of crowdsourcing platforms for workers. This setting imposes a challenge on how to simultaneously achieve reward maximization while subjecting to anytime cumulative constraints. To address such challenge, we propose a primal-dual algorithm (Neural-PD) whose primal component adopts multi-layer perceptrons to estimate reward and cost functions, and its dual component estimates the Lagrange multiplier with the virtual queue. By integrating neural tangent kernel theory and Lyapunov-drift techniques, we prove Neural-PD achieves a sharp regret bound and a zero constraint violation.

The classic model considers the reward of a pulled arm to be observed after a time delay that is sampled from a random distribution assigned for each arm. In this paper, we propose an extended framework in which pulling an arm gives both an instant (short-term) reward and a delayed (long-term) reward at the same time. The distributions of reward values for short-term and long-term rewards are related with a previously known relationship. The distribution of time delay for an arm is independent of the reward distributions of the arm. In our work, we devise three UCB-based algorithms, where two of them are near-optimal-regret algorithms for this new model, with the corresponding regret analysis for each one of them. Additionally, the random distributions for time delay values are allowed to yield infinite time, which corresponds to a case where the arm only gives a short-term reward. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms and compare this paradigm with previously known models on both a synthetic data set and a real data set that would reflect one of the potential applications of this model.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:47","2023-09-19 10:39:47","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we show that due to the amplified noise, directly streaming the video in low-light scenarios can introduce significant bandwidth inefficiency.In this paper, we propose Owl, an intelligent framework to optimize the bandwidth utilization and inference accuracy for the low-light video analytic pipeline. The core idea of Owl is two-fold: on the one hand, we will deploy a light-weighted pre-processing module before transmission, through which we will get the denoised video and significantly reduce the transmitted data; on the other hand, we recover the information from the denoised video via an enhancement module in the server-side. Specifically, through well-designed training mechanism and content representation technique, Owl can dynamically select the best configuration for time-varying videos.

Pessimistic-optimistic algorithms, which combine bandit learning with virtual queues to track the constraints, are commonly employed in the former. Block-based algorithms, where switching is disallowed within a block, are commonly employed in the latter. While efficient algorithms have been developed for both problems, it remains challenging to guarantee low regret and constraint violation in a bandit problem that includes both arm selection constraints and switching costs due to the tight coupling between the two. Here, switching may be necessary to decrease the constraint violation but comes at the cost of increased switching regret. In this paper, we tackle the constrained bandits with switching costs problem, for which we design a block-based pessimistic-optimistic algorithm. We identify three timely wireless networking applications for this framework in edge computing, mobile crowdsensing, and wireless network selection.

Thus, current solutions for in-switch inference that are compatible with production-level hardware lack support for complex features or suffer from limited scalability, and hit performance barriers in complex tasks involving large decision spaces. To address this limitation, we present Flowrest, a first complete Random Forest (RF) model implementation that operates at the level of individual flows in commercial switches. Our solution builds on (i) an original framework to embed flow-level machine learning models into programmable switch ASICs, and (ii) novel guidelines for tailoring RF models to operations in programmable switches already at the design stage. We implement Flowrest as an open-source software using the P4 language, and assess its performance in an experimental platform based on Intel Tofino switches.

However, how much and when an ML model should be compressed, and where its training should be executed, are hard decisions to make, as they depend on the model itself, the resources of the available nodes, and the data such nodes own. Existing studies focus on each of those aspects individually, however, they do not account for how such decisions can be made jointly and adapted to one another. In this work, we model the network system focusing on the training of DNNs, formalize the above multi-dimensional problem, and, given its NP-hardness, formulate an approximate dynamic programming problem that we solve through the PACT algorithmic framework. Importantly, PACT leverages a time-expanded graph representing the learning process, and a data-driven and theoretical approach for the prediction of the loss evolution to be expected as a consequence of training decisions. We prove that PACT’s solutions can get as close to the optimum as desired, at the cost of an increased time complexity, and that, in any case, such complexity is polynomial. Numerical results also show that, even under the most disadvantageous settings, PACT outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives and closely matches the optimal energy cost.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:48","2023-09-19 10:39:48","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although wireless mesh networks work satisfactorily most of the time thanks to years of research, they are often complex and difficult to manage once the networks are deployed. Moreover, the deliveries of time-critical messages suffer long delay, because all messages have to go through hop-by-hop transport. Recent studies show that adding a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) radio to each device in the network can effectively overcome such limitations, because network management and time-critical messages can be transmitted from gateway to field devices directly through long-distance LPWAN links. However, industry practitioners have shown a marked reluctance to embrace the new solution because of the high cost of hardware modification. This paper presents a novel system, namely DIrect MEssage dissemination (DIME) system, that leverages the cross-technology communication technique to enable the direct message dissemination from gateway to field devices in industrial wireless networks without the need to add a second radio to each field device.

To secure existing surveillance systems, in this paper we propose a vision-WiFi cross-modal video forgery detection system, namely WiSil. Leveraging a theoretical model based on the principle of signal propagation, WiSil constructs wave front information of the object in the monitoring area from WiFi signals. With a well-designed deep learning network, WiSil further recovers silhouettes from the wave front information. Based on a Siamese network-based semantic feature extractor, WiSil can eventually determine whether a frame is manipulated by comparing the semantic feature vectors extracted from the video’s silhouette with those extracted from the WiFi’s silhouette. Extensive experiments show that WiSil can achieve 95% accuracy in detecting tampered frames. Moreover, WiSil is robust against environment and person changes.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:50","2023-09-19 10:39:50","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, OFN leverages nearby online finder devices to conduct neighbor discovery via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), so as to detect the presence of offline missing devices and report an encrypted location back to the owner via the Internet. The user experience in OFN is closely related to the success ratio (possibility) of finding the lost device, where the latency of the prerequisite stage, i.e., neighbor discovery, matters. However, the crowd-sourced finder devices show diversity in scan modes due to different power modes or different manufacturers, resulting in local optima of neighbor discovery performance. In this paper, we present a brand-new broadcast mode called ElastiCast to deal with the scan mode diversity issues. ElastiCast captures the key features of BLE neighbor discovery and globally optimizes the broadcast mode interacting with diverse scan modes. Experimental evaluation results and commercial product deployment experience demonstrate that ElastiCast is effective in achieving stable and bounded neighbor discovery latency within the power budget.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:51","2023-09-19 10:39:51","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This rapid iteration on LPWAN, however, forms a communication barrier between legacy wireless sensor nodes deployed years ago (e.g., ZigBee-based sensor node) with their latest competitor running a different communication protocol (e.g., LoRa-based IoT node): they work on the same frequency band but share different MAC- and PHY-layer regulations and thus cannot talk to each other directly. To break this barrier, we propose LigBee, a cross-technology communication (CTC) solution that enables symbol-level communication from the latest LPWAN LoRa node to legacy ZIGBEE node. We have implemented LigBee on both software-defined radios and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa and ZigBee nodes, and demonstrated that LigBee builds a reliable CTC link from LoRa node to ZigBee node on both platforms. Our experimental results show that i) LigBee achieves a bit error rate (BER) in the order of 10−3 with 70 ∼ 80% frame reception ratio (FRR), ii) the range of LigBee link is over 300m, which is 6 ∼ 7.5× the typical range of legacy ZigBee and state-of-the-art solution, and iii) the throughput of LigBee link is maintained on the order of kbps, which is close to the LoRa’s throughput.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:51","2023-09-19 10:39:51","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we study a new intracorporal biometrics combining the uniqueness of i) heart motion, ii) bone conduction, and iii) body asymmetry. Specifically, we design HeartPrint as a passive yet secure user authentication system: it exploits the bone-conducted heart sounds captured by (widely available) dual in-ear microphones (IEMs) to authenticate users, while neatly leveraging IEMs renders itself transparent to users without impairing the normal functions of earphones. To suppress the interference from other body sounds and audio produced by the earphones, we develop a novel interference elimination method using modified non-negative matrix factorization to separate clean heart sounds from background interference. We further explore the uniqueness of IEM-recorded heart sounds in three aspects to extract a novel biometric representation, based on which HeartPrint leverages a convolutional neural model equipped with a continual learning method to achieve accurate authentication under drifting body conditions.

The measurement data reveals that the user’s exiting behavior in viewing video streams is an appropriate choice as a continuous-time QoE metric. Secondly, we build a quantitative QoE model to objectively assess the quality of video playback by discretizing the playback session into the Markov chain. By collecting 7 billion viewing session logs which cover users from 20 CDN providers and 40 Internet service providers, the proposed state-chain-based model of State-Exiting Ratio (SER) is validated.

However, when massive users train a large machine learning model through federated learning, the dynamically varying and often heavy communication overhead can put significant pressure on the network operator. The operator may choose to dynamically change the network prices in response, which will eventually affect the payoffs of the server and users. This paper considers the under-explored yet important issue of the joint design of participation incentives (for encouraging users’ contribution to federated learning) and network pricing (for managing network resources). Due to heterogeneous users’ private information and multi-dimensional decisions, the optimization problems in Stage I of multi-stage games are non-convex. Nevertheless, we are able to analytically derive the corresponding optimal contract and pricing mechanism through proper transformations of constraints, variables, and functions, under both vertical and horizontal interaction structures of the participants. We show that the vertical structure is better than the horizontal one, as it avoids the interests misalignment between the server and the network operator. Numerical results based on real-world datasets show that our proposed mechanisms decrease server’s cost by up to 24.87% comparing with the state-of-the-art benchmarks.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:52","2023-09-19 10:39:52","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our goal is to characterize worst-case attacks on such systems.We use queueing models to study attackers who wish to maximize damage while constrained by attack resources. A key question pertaining to systems design is whether a damage maximizing attack should focus on heavily affecting a small number of facilities or spread its efforts over many facilities.We analyze attacks which damage the system resources (i.e., Capacity attacks) and show that optimal capacity attacks are concentrated. We further use a Max-Min (attacker and defender) analysis where the defender can migrate requests in response to the attack: An intriguing result is that under certain conditions an optimal attack will spread its efforts over many sites. This is in contrast to the attack concentration predictions of (agnostic to queueing delays) prior studies.We also address DDoS (or Flow) attacks where attackers create loads of dummy requests and send them to the system.

Distributed quantum computing provides a scalable path to execute more complicated computational tasks that a single quantum processor cannot handle. Yet, distributed quantum computing needs a new compiler to map logical qubits of a quantum circuit to different quantum processors in the system. This paper formulates and studies the qubit allocation problem for distributed quantum computing (QA-DQC). We prove the NP-hardness of the formulated problem. Moreover, we show there is no polynomial-time na-approximation algorithm for any a < 1 unless P = NP, where n is the number of processors in the quantum network. We first propose a heuristic local search algorithm for QA-DQC. Furthermore, we design a multistage hybrid simulated annealing algorithm (MHSA) by combining the local search algorithm and a simulated annealing meta-heuristic algorithm.

FPGA-based reconfigurable accelerators have high energy efficiency and low latency compared to general-purpose servers. Therefore, it is natural to incorporate reconfigurable accelerators in mobile edge computing systems. This paper formulates and studies the problem of joint task offloading, access point selection, and resource allocation in heterogeneous edge environments for latency minimization. Due to the heterogeneity in edge computing devices and the coupling between offloading, access point selection, and resource allocation decisions, it is challenging to optimize over them simultaneously. We decomposed the proposed problem into two disjoint subproblems and developed algorithms for them. The first subproblem is to jointly determine offloading and computing resource allocation decisions and is NP-hard, where we developed an algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation. The second subproblem is to jointly determine access point selection and communication resource allocation decisions, where we proposed an algorithm with a provable approximation ratio of 2.62.

This paper proposes a design called Nimble for interleaving these tasks to complete both more efficiently while ensuring complete processing of traffic by the required NFs, provided that the route-update protocol enforces a specific property that we define.

In this paper, we consider buffer-aware adaptive bitrate (ABR) mechanisms to overcome the above concerns. Formulating the buffer-aware rate adaptation problem as multi-objective optimization, we propose DeepBuffer, a deep reinforcement learning-based approach that jointly takes proper bitrate and controls the maximum buffer. To deal with the challenges of learning-based buffer-aware ABR composition, such as infinite possible plans, multiple bitrate levels, and complex action space, we design adequate preference-driven inputs, separate action outputs, and invent high sample-efficiency training methodologies. We train DeepBuffer with a broad set of real-world network traces and provide a comprehensive evaluation in terms of various network scenarios and different video types. Experimental results indicate that DeepBuffer rivals or outperforms recent heuristics and learning-based ABR schemes in terms of QoE while heavily reducing the average buffer consumption by up to 90%.

SkyNet computes the 3D position of a person by cross searching from multiple views. To achieve high accuracy in identification, SkyNet fuses aerial images of multiple drones according to their legibility. Moreover, by predicting the estimated finishing time of tasks, SkyNet schedules and balances workloads among edge devices and the cloud server to minimize processing latency. We implement and deploy SkyNet in real life, and evaluate the performance of identification and localization with 20 human participants.

However, little work has explored how different factors relate to their popularity evolution patterns. In this paper, we will investigate a critical problem, i.e., how to discover the promising streamers in their early stage? To tackle this problem, we first conduct large-scale measurement on a real-world CLS dataset. We find that streamers can indeed be clustered into two evolution types (i.e., rising type and normal type), and these two types of streamers will show differences in some inherent properties. Traditional time-sequential models cannot handle this problem, because they are unable to capture the complicated interactivity and extensive heterogeneity in CLS scenarios. To address their shortcomings, we further propose Niffler, a novel heterogeneous attention temporal graph framework (HATG) for predicting the evolution types of CLS streamers. Specifically, through the graph neural network (GNN) and gated-recurrent-unit (GRU) structure, Niffler can capture both the interactive features and the evolutionary dynamics. Moreover, by integrating the attention mechanism in the model design, Niffler can intelligently preserve the heterogeneity when learning different levels of node representations.

However, the increasing scale of RDMA networks requires hosts to establish a large number of connections, e.g., process-level full mesh, which easily overwhelms the limited resource on RNICs and hence significantly degrades performance. This paper presents SRM, a scalable transport mode for RDMA that remarkably alleviates resource exhaustion on RNICs. SRM proposes a kernel-based solution to multiplex workloads from different applications over the same connection. Meanwhile, to preserve RDMA’s performance benefits, SRM 1) avoids syscall overhead by sharing the working memory between user-space and kernel; 2) maintains high resource utilization through lock-free approach to avoid contention; 3) adopts multiple optimizations to mitigate the head-of-line blocking issue; 4) implements a rapid recovery mechanism to provide high system robustness. We evaluate SRM using extensive experiments and simulations. Testbed experiments reveal that SRM outperforms existing transports, including DCT, RC, and XRC, by 4x to 20x in latency for all-to-all communication pattern.

Recent efforts leverage the DNN-based encoder-decoder framework to exploit correlations within the CSI matrix for better CSI compression. However, existing works have not fully exploited the unique features of CSI, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance under high compression ratios and sensitivity to multipath effects. Instead of treating CSI as common 2D matrices like images, we reveal the intrinsic stripe-based correlation across the CSI matrix. Driven by this insight, we propose CSI-StripeFormer, a stripe-aware encoder-decoder framework to exploit the unique stripe feature for better CSI compression. We design a lightweight encoder with asymmetric convolution kernels to capture various shape features. We further incorporate novel designs tailored for stripe features, including a novel hierarchical Transformer backbone in the decoder and a hybrid attention mechanism to extract and fuse correlations in angular and delay domains. Our evaluation results show that our system achieves an over 7dB channel reconstruction gain under a high compression ratio of 64 in multipath-rich scenarios, significantly superior to current state-of-the-art approaches.

The majority of existing works study bandits problems in either the stochastic reward regime or the adversarial reward regime, but the intersection of these two regimes is much less investigated. In this paper, we study a new bandits problem, called adversarial group linear bandits (AGLB), that features reward generation as a joint outcome of both the stochastic process and the adversarial behavior. In particular, the reward that the learner receives is not only a noisy linear function of the arm that the learner selects within a group but also depends on the group-level attack decision by the adversary. Such problems are present in many real-world applications, e.g., collaborative edge inference and multi-site online ad placement. To combat the uncertainty in the coupled stochastic and adversarial rewards, we develop a new bandits algorithm, called EXPUCB, which marries the classical LinUCB and EXP3 algorithms, and prove its sublinear regret. We apply EXPUCB to the collaborative edge inference problem and evaluate its performance.

The mainstream Docker containers are structured in layers, which are organized in stack with bottom-up dependency. To start a microservice, the required layers are pulled from a remote registry and stored on its host server, following the layer dependency order. This incurs long microservice startup time and hinders the performance efficiency. In this paper, we discover that, for the first time, the layer pulling order can be adjusted to accelerate the microservice startup. Specifically, we address the problem on microservice layer pulling orchestration for startup time minimization and prove it as NP-hard. We propose a Longest-chain based Out-of-order layer Pulling Orchestration (LOPO) strategy with low computational complexity and guaranteed approximation ratio.

In distributed systems with constrained resources and potentially high dynamics, e.g., mobile edge networks, the efficiency of FL is an important problem. Existing works have separately considered different configurations to make FL more efficient, such as infrequent transmission of model updates, client subsampling, and compression of update vectors. However, an important open problem is how to jointly apply and tune these control knobs in a single FL algorithm, to achieve the best performance by allowing a high degree of freedom in control decisions. In this paper, we address this problem and propose FlexFL – an FL algorithm with multiple options that can be adjusted flexibly. Our FlexFL algorithm allows both arbitrary rates of local computation at clients and arbitrary amounts of communication between clients and the server, making both the computation and communication resource consumption adjustable. We prove a convergence upper bound of this algorithm. Based on this result, we further propose a stochastic optimization formulation and algorithm to determine the control decisions that (approximately) minimize the convergence bound, while conforming to constraints related to resource consumption. The advantage of our approach is also verified using experiments.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:57","2023-09-19 10:39:57","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To transfer data among geographically distributed datacenters, cloud providers need to purchase bandwidth from ISPs. The data transferring cost has become one of the major expenses for cloud providers. Therefore, it is essential for a cloud provider to carefully allocate inter-datacenter traffic among the ISPs' links to minimize the costs. Exiting solutions mainly focus on the situations where all links adopt the same pricing scheme. However, in practice, ISPs usually provide multiple pricing schemes for their links due to market competition, which makes the existing solutions nonoptimal. Thus, a new traffic engineering approach that considers various pricing schemes is needed. This paper presents COIN, a new framework for cost-efficient traffic engineering with various pricing schemes. We propose a partition rounding traffic engineering algorithm based on linear independence analysis. The approximation factors and time complexity are formally analyzed. We further conduct large-scale simulations with real- world topologies and datasets. Extensive simulation results show that COIN can save the data transferring cost by up to 54.54% compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:57","2023-09-19 10:39:57","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such charging scenarios, the radio waves radiated from multiple chargers will interfere with each other. Though a few work have realized the wave interference, they do not fully utilize the high power caused by constructive interference while avoiding the negative impacts brought by the destructive interference. In this paper, we aim to investigate the power distribution regularity of concurrent charging and take full advantage of the high power to enhance the charging efficiency. Specifically, we formulate a concurrent charGing utility mAxImizatioN (GAIN) problem and build a practical charging model with wave interference. Further, we propose a concurrent charging scheme, which not only can improve the power of interference enhanced regions by deploying chargers, but also find a set of points with the highest power to locate sensors.

As a consequence, latency-sensitive users must bid against each other and pay higher fees to ensure that their transactions are processed in priority. However, most of the time of a blockchain system (78% in Ethereum), there is still a lot of unused computational power, with few users sending transactions. To address this issue and reduce latency for users, we propose the latency-first smart contract model in this paper, which optimistically accepts committed transactions. This allows users to submit a commitment during times of high demand, and then complete the rest of the work at a lower priority. From the perspective of the blockchain, this temporarily ""overclocks"" the system. We have developed a programming tool for our model, and our experiments show that the proposed latency-first smart contract model can greatly reduce latency during the periods of high demand.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:58","2023-09-19 10:39:58","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we address such challenges by formulating a container placement and data flow routing problem, which fully considers the heterogeneity of edge networks and the overhead of operating serverless platforms on resource-limited edge servers. We design an online algorithm to solve the problem. We further show its local optimum for each arriving container and prove its theoretical guarantee to the optimal offline solution.

Such a machine unlearning problem becomes even more challenging in the context of federated learning, where clients collaborate to train a global model with their private data. When a client requests its data to be erased, its effects have already gradually permeated through a large number of clients, as the server aggregates client updates over multiple communication rounds. All of these affected clients need to participate in the retraining process, leading to prohibitive retraining costs with respect to the wall-clock training time.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Knot, a new clustered aggregation mechanism custom-tailored to asynchronous federated learning. The design of Knot is based upon our intuition that, with asynchronous federated learning, clients can be divided into clusters, and aggregation can be performed within each cluster only so that retraining due to data erasure can be limited to within each cluster as well. To optimize client-cluster assignment, we formulated a lexicographical minimization problem that could be transformed into a linear programming problem and solved efficiently. Over a variety of datasets and tasks, we have shown clear evidence that Knot outperformed the state-of-the-art federated unlearning mechanisms by up to 85% in the context of asynchronous federated learning.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:59","2023-09-19 10:39:59","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with omnidirectional charging, the MC equipped with directional antenna can concentrate energy in the intended direction, making charging more efficient. However, all prior arts ignore the considerable energy leakage behind the directional antenna (i.e., back lobe), resulting in energy wasted in vain. To address this issue, we study a fundamental problem of how to utilize the neglected back lobe and schedule the directional MC efficiently. Towards this end, we first build and verify a directional charging model considering both main and back lobes. Then, we focus on jointly optimizing the number of dead sensors and energy usage effectiveness. We achieve these by introducing a scheduling scheme that utilizes both main and back lobes to charge multiple sensors simultaneously. Finally, extensive simulations and field experiments demonstrate that our scheme reduces the number of dead sensors by 49.5% and increases the energy usage effectiveness by 10.2% on average as compared with existing algorithms.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:39:59","2023-09-19 10:39:59","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One promising approach for this problem is to utilize in-band physical-layer radio-frequency (RF) signals for authenticated key establishment because of the efficiency and high usability. However, existing in-band authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocols are mostly vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, which can be launched by modifying the transmitted wireless signals over the air. By annihilating legitimate signals and injecting malicious signals, signal modification attackers are able to completely control the communication channels and spoof victim wireless devices. State-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques addressing such attacks require additional auxiliary hardware or are limited to single attackers. This paper proposes a novel in-band security bootstrapping technique that can thwart colluding signal modification attackers. Different from SOTA solutions, our design is compatible with commodity devices without requiring additional hardware. We achieve this based on the internal randomness of each device that is unpredictable to attackers. Any modification to RF signals will be detected with high probabilities. Extensive security analysis and experimentation on the USRP platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our design under various attack strategies.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:00","2023-09-19 10:40:00","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show via a simple case study that learning-content attacks are indeed feasible and can infer sensitive information in short time under a real cloud setting. To this end, we present FeatureSpy, a secure deduplicated storage system that effectively detects learning-content attacks based on the observation that such attacks often generate a large volume of similar data. FeatureSpy builds on two core design elements, namely (i) similarity-preserving encryption that supports similarity detection on encrypted chunks and (ii) shielded attack detection that leverages Intel SGX to accurately detect learning-content attacks without being readily evaded by adversaries.

To make the most out of both worlds, we develop Ahaggar, a learning-based scheme running on the server side that provides quality-aware bitrate guidance to streaming clients running their own heuristics. Ahaggar’s novelty is the meta reinforcement learning approach taking network conditions, clients’ statuses and device resolutions, and streamed content as input features to perform bitrate guidance.

It splits nodes into multiple groups so that they can process transactions in parallel. To achieve higher parallelism and concurrency at large scales, it is desirable to maintain a large number of small shards. However, simply configuring small shards easily results in a higher fraction of malicious nodes inside shards, causing shard corruption and compromising system security. Existing sharding techniques hence demand large shards, at the expense of limited concurrency. To address this limitation, we propose CoChain: a blockchain sharding system that can securely configure small shards for enhanced concurrency. CoChain allows some shards to be corrupted. For security, each shard is monitored by multiple other shards. The latter reach a cross-shard Consensus on the Consensus results of their monitored shard. Once a corrupted shard is found, its subsequent consensus will be taken over by another shard, hence recovering the system. Via Consensus on Consensus, CoChain allows the existence of shards with more fraction of malicious nodes (<2/3) while securing the system, thus reducing the shard size safely. We implement CoChain based on Harmony and conduct extensive experiments. Compared with Harmony, CoChain achieves 35x throughput gain with 6,000+ nodes.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:01","2023-09-19 10:40:01","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although promising, the current tensor completion models adopted in network traffic data recovery lack an effective and efficient retraining scheme to adapt to newly arrived data while retaining historical information. To solve the problem, we propose LightNestle, a novel sequential tensor completion scheme based on meta-learning, which designs (1) an expressive neural network to transfer spatial knowledge from previous embeddings to current embeddings; (2) an attention-based module to transfer temporal patterns into current embeddings in linear complexity; and (3) meta-learning-based algorithms to iteratively recover missing data and update transfer modules to catch up with learned knowledge.

However, low-quality video is inevitably collected by existing surveillance systems because of poor quality cameras or over-compressed/pruned video streaming protocols, e.g., as a result of upstream bandwidth limit. To address this issue, existing studies use quality enhancers (e.g., neural super-resolution) to improve the quality of videos (e.g., resolution) and eventually ensure inference accuracy. Nevertheless, directly applying quality enhancers does not work in practice because it will introduce unacceptable latency. In this paper, we present AccDecoder, a novel accelerated decoder for real-time and neural-enhanced video analytics. AccDecoder can select a few frames adaptively via Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance the quality by neural super-resolution and then up-scale the unselected frames that reference them, which leads to 6-21% accuracy improvement. AccDecoder provides efficient inference capability via filtering important frames using DRL for DNN-based inference and reusing the results for the other frames via extracting the reference relationship among frames and blocks, which results in a latency reduction of 20-80% than baselines.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:02","2023-09-19 10:40:02","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In FRR no notification messages are required as the nodes adjacent to the failure are prepared with a routing table such that the packets are re-routed only based on local information. However, designing the routing algorithm for FRR is challenging because the number of possible sets of failed network links and nodes can be extremely high, while the algorithm should keep track of which nodes are aware of the failure. In this paper, we propose a generic algorithmic framework that combines the benefits of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and an effective approach from graph theory related to constructive graph characterization of k-connected graphs, i.e., edge splitting-off. We illustrate these benefits through arborescence design for FRR and show that (i) due to the ILP we have great flexibility in defining the routing problem, while (ii) the problem can still be solved very fast.

However, little attention has been paid to studying the impact of ISCs on Internet routing. This study addresses two questions to bridge the gap between ISCs and Internet routing: (1) For a given ISC, which Autonomous Systems (ASes) are using it, and (2) How dependent is Internet routing on ISCs. To tackle the first question, we propose Topology to Topology (or T2T), a framework for the large-scale measurement of static mapping between ASes and ISCs, and apply T2T to the Internet to reveal the status, trends, and preferences of ASes using ISCs. We find that ISCs used by Tier-1 ASes are more than 30× of stub ASes. For the second question, we design an Internet routing simulator, and evaluate the behavior change of Internet routing when an ISC fails based on the mapping between ASes and ISCs. The results show that benefited from the complex mesh of ISCs, the failures of most ISCs have limited impact on Internet routing, while a few ISCs can have a significant impact.

The sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) technique pushes the model size to a trillion-level with a sub-linear increase of computations as an MoE layer can be equipped with many separate experts, but only one or two experts need to be trained for each input data. However, the feature of dynamically activating experts of MoE introduces extensive communications in distributed training. In this work, we propose PipeMoE to adaptively pipeline the communications and computations in MoE to maximally hide the communication time. Specifically, we first identify the root reason why a higher pipeline degree does not always achieve better performance in training MoE models. Then we formulate an optimization problem that aims to minimize the training iteration time. To solve this problem, we build performance models for computation and communication tasks in MoE and develop an optimal solution to determine the pipeline degree such that the iteration time is minimal. We conduct extensive experiments with 174 typical MoE layers and two real-world NLP models on a 64-GPU cluster. Experimental results show that our PipeMoE almost always chooses the best pipeline degree and outperforms state-of-the-art MoE training systems by 5%-77% in training time.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:04","2023-09-19 10:40:04","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the P4 language makes it possible to carry out some simple packet processing tasks in the data plane, i.e., on the switch itself (without real-time support from the SDN controller or a server). However, owing to the limitations of packet parsing in P4, these tasks involve only the packet headers. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) – i.e., inspection of the packet payload – in the data plane, using P4 alone. We make use of the fact that in P4, a switch can clone and recirculate packets. One copy (clone) can be recirculated, slicing off a byte in each round, and using a finite-state machine to check if a target string has yet been seen. If the target string is found, the other copy (original packet) is discarded; if not, it is passed through. Our approach allows us to build the first application-layer firewall (URL filter) in the data plane, and to achieve essentially line-rate performance while filtering thousands of URLs, on a commodity programmable switch. It may in future also be used for other DPI tasks.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:04","2023-09-19 10:40:04","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the parallelism of both computation and communication, the problem of Minimum Latency joint Communication and Computation Scheduling (MLCCS) is studied recently. However, existing works have rigid assumptions that the communication time of each device is fixed and the workload can be split arbitrarily small. Aiming at making the work more practical and general, the MLCCS problem without the above assumptions is studied in this paper. Firstly, the MLCCS problem under a general model is formulated and proved to be NP-hard. Secondly, a pyramid-based computing model is proposed to consider the parallelism of communication and computation jointly, which has an approximation ratio of 1 + δ, where δ is related to devices’ communication rates. An interesting property under such computing model is identified and proved, i.e., the optimal latency can be obtained under arbitrary scheduling order when all the devices share the same communication rate. When the devices own different communication rates, the optimal scheduling order is also obtained. Additionally, when the workload cannot be split arbitrarily, an approximation algorithm with ratio of at most 2 (1 + δ) is proposed. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm has high performance in terms of latency. Two testbed experiments are also conducted, which show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods, reducing the latency by up to 29.2% in real-world applications.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:04","2023-09-19 10:40:04","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enabling concurrent transmissions among many LoRa backscatter tags is desirable for large-scale backscatter networks. However, LoRa backscatter signals sitting on linear chirps easily interfere with each other degrading the throughput of concurrent transmissions. In this paper, we propose Prism that utilizes different types of non-linear chirps to modulate backscatter data allowing multiple backscatter tags to transmit concurrently in the same channel. By taking linear chirps from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes as excitation sources, how to convert the linear chirps to their non-linear counterparts is not trivial on resource-limited backscatter tags. To solve this challenge, we design a lightweight and low-power method, including a frequency-shift function and hardware framework, to shift the frequency of the linear chirps to the non-linear chirps accurately. Moreover, we develop effective methods to calibrate various offsets and concentrate chirp energy to achieve reliable decoding. We implement Prism with customized low-cost hardware, process backscatter signals with USRP, and evaluate its performance in both indoor and outdoor environments. The results show that seven tags can transmit concurrently with less than 1% bit error rate by using seven different types of non-linear chirps in the same channel, resulting in a 6× higher transmission concurrency than state-of-the-art.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:05","2023-09-19 10:40:05","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, edge solutions are typically resource-constrained, posing reliability challenges due to heightened contention for compute capacities and faulty application behavior in the presence of overload conditions. Although a large amount of generated log data can be mined for fault prediction, labeling this data for training is a manual process and thus a limiting factor for automation. Due to this, many companies resort to unsupervised fault-tolerance models. Yet, failure models of this kind can incur a loss of accuracy when they need to adapt to non-stationary workloads and diverse host characteristics. Thus, we propose a novel modeling approach, DeepFT, to proactively avoid system overloads and their adverse effects by optimizing the task scheduling decisions. DeepFT uses a deep-surrogate model to accurately predict and diagnose faults in the system and co-simulation based self-supervised learning to dynamically adapt the model in volatile settings. Experimentation on an edge cluster shows that DeepFT can outperform state-of-the-art methods in fault-detection and QoS metrics. Specifically, DeepFT gives the highest F1 scores for fault-detection, reducing service deadline violations by up to 37% while also improving response time by up to 9%.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:06","2023-09-19 10:40:06","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The edge server aims to minimize the sum of a request forwarding cost (i.e., the cost of forwarding requests to remote data centers to process) and a service instantiating cost (i.e., that of retrieving and setting up a service). Considering request patterns are usually non-stationary in practice, the performance of the edge server is measured by dynamic regret, which compares the total cost with that of the dynamic optimal offline solution.

For each problem, typically a custom-designed scheduler was developed. Instead of following the (custom-design) path, we pursue a general framework that can be applied to design a wide range of schedulers to solve AoI-related optimization problems. As a first step toward this vision, we present a general framework—Eywa, that can be applied to construct high-performance schedulers for a family of AoI-related optimization problems, all sharing a common setting of an IoT data collection network. We show how to apply Eywa to solve two important AoI-related problems: to minimize the weighted sum of AoIs and to minimize the bandwidth requirement under AoI constraints.

However, it remains open to meeting the increasing demand for similarity retrieval across servers. The intrinsic reason is that the existing solutions can only return an exact data match for a query while more general edge applications require the data similar to a query input from any server. To fill this gap, this paper pioneers a new paradigm to support high-dimensional similarity search at network edges. Specifically, we propose Prophet, the first known architecture for similarity data indexing. We first divide the feature space of data into plenty of subareas, then project both subareas and edge servers into a virtual plane where the distances between any two points can reflect not only data similarity but also network latency. When any edge server submits a request for data insert, delete, or query, it computes the data feature and the virtual coordinates; then iteratively forwards the request through greedy routing based on the forwarding tables and the virtual coordinates. By Prophet, similar high-dimensional features would be stored by a common server or several nearby servers. Compared with distributed hash tables in P2P networks, Prophet requires logarithmic servers to access for a data request and reduces the network latency from the logarithmic to the constant level of the server number. Experimental results indicate that Prophet achieves comparable retrieval accuracy and shortens the query latency by 55%~70% compared with centralized schemes.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:08","2023-09-19 10:40:08","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the privacy concerns and limitations of devices’ computing resources compromise the practical effectiveness of PCA. We propose a federated PCA learning using Grassmann manifold optimization, which coordinates IoT devices to aggregate a joint profile of normal network behaviors for anomaly detection.

Stochastic resonance (SR) provides a new way for weak-signal detection by boosting undetectable signals with added white noise. However, existing work has to take a long time to search optimal parameter settings for SR, which cannot fit well some time-critical applications. In this paper, we propose an adaptive SR scheme (ASR) that can amplify the original signal at a low cost in time. The basic idea is that we find that the potential parameter is a key factor that determines the performance of SR. By treating the system as a feedback loop, we can dynamically adjust the potential parameters according to the output signals and make SR happen adaptively. ASR answered two technical questions: how can we evaluate the output signal and how can we tune the potential parameters quickly towards the optimal. In ASR, we first design a spectral-analysis based solution to examine whether SR happens using continuous wavelet transform. After that, we reduce the parameter tuning problem to a constrained non-linear optimization problem and use the sequential quadratic programming to iteratively optimize the potential parameters. We implement ASR and apply it in two ubiquitous computing applications: respiration-rate detection and machinery fault diagnosis.

Compared with hardware ones, software shapers are more flexible to be developed and deployed, and thus are very attractive. Nevertheless, software approaches are still unsatisfactory as they struggle to saturate 40Gbps and higher speed.While much effort has been made to reduce the intrinsic overhead of software traffic shaping, we find that it is the extrinsic overhead, such as PCIe communications and interrupts, that hinders shaping from achieving 40Gbps - 100Gbps speed. Batching is an effective way to amortize these overheads. However, blindly batching can degrade the network performance, as it introduces bursts into the network. Diving into the dilemma, we find that intra-flow burst is to blame for harming the network performance, while inter-flow burst, consisting of packets from different flows, can be naturally demultiplexed in the network.Based on the insight, we present FlowBundler, which can achieve efficient traffic shaping by inter-flow batching. Testbed experiments show that FlowBundler can achieve an accurate shaping of 98Gbps with a single CPU core, which is 2.6× better than state-of-the-art approaches.

Thus motivated, we study the joint edge aggregation and association problem to minimize the total cost, where the model aggregation over multiple cells just happens at the network edge. After proving its hardness with complex coupled variables, we transform it into a set function optimization problem and prove the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular, which further complicates the problem. To tackle this difficulty, we first split it into multiple edge association subproblems, where the optimal solution to the computation resource allocation can be efficiently obtained in the closed form. We then construct a substitute function with the supermodularity and provable upper bound. On this basis, we reformulate an equivalent set function minimization problem under a matroid base constraint.

It is critical for many applications, e.g., system optimization and smartphone resource management. Recently, graph based App prediction approaches have been proved effective, but still suffer from several issues. First, these studies cannot naturally generalize to unseen Apps. Second, they do not model asymmetric transitions between Apps. Third, they are hard to differentiate the contributions of different App usage context on the prediction result. In this paper, we propose GinApp, an inductive graph representation learning based framework, to resolve these issues. Specifically, we first construct an attribute-aware directed graph based on App usage records, where the App-App transitions and times are modeled by directed weighed edges.

Finally, our App usage prediction task is formulated as a link prediction problem on graph to generate the Apps with the largest probabilities as prediction results.

However, kernel-based tools exhibit poor scalability in attack traffic generation while kernel-bypassing tools result in unacceptable monetary cost. We propose Excalibur, a scalable and low-cost testing framework for DDoS defense solutions. The key idea is to leverage the programmable switch to perform testing tasks with Tbps-level scalability and low cost. Specifically, Excalibur coordinates both a server and a programmable switch to jointly perform testing tasks. It realizes flexible attack traffic generation, which requires a large number of resources, in the server while using the switch to increase the sending rate of attack traffic to Tbps-level. Our experiments on a 64×100Gbps Tofino switch show that Excalibur achieves orders-of-magnitude higher scalability and lower cost than existing tools.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:14","2023-09-19 10:40:14","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In multi-hop UAV networks, the successful transmission of these tasks to the edge is severely challenged due to severe bandwidth constraints. For this reason, we propose a novel A2-UAV framework to optimize the number of correctly executed tasks at the edge. In stark contrast with existing art, we take an application-aware approach and formulate a novel Application-Aware Task Planning Problem (A2-TPP) that takes into account (i) the relationship between deep neural network (DNN) accuracy and image compression for the classes of interest based on the available dataset, (ii) the target positions, (iii) the current energy/position of the UAVs to optimize routing, data pre-processing and target assignment for each UAV. We demonstrate A2-TPP is NP-Hard and propose a polynomial-time algorithm to solve it efficiently. We extensively evaluate A2-UAV through real-world experiments with a testbed composed by four DJI Mavic Air 2 UAVs. We consider state-of-the-art image classification tasks with four different DNN models (i.e., DenseNet, ResNet152, ResNet50 and MobileNet-V2) and object detection tasks using YoloV4 trained on the ImageNet dataset.

Beam management in 5G-NR actively monitors candidate beam pair links (BPLs) on the serving cell to simply select the user’s best beam, but neglects the multi-user resource sharing problem, potentially leading to severe throughput degradation on overloaded cells. We propose flexRLM, a coordinator-based flexible radio link monitoring (RLM) framework for multi-user downlink mm-wave networks. flexRLM enables flexible configuration of monitored BPLs on the serving and other candidate cells and beam selection jointly considering link quality and resource sharing. flexRLM is fully 5G-NR-compliant and uses the LTE coordinator in non-standalone mode to continuously update the monitored BPLs via measurement reports from periodic downlink control synchronization signals. We implement flexRLM in ns-3 and present full-stack simulations to demonstrate the superior performance of flexRLM over default 5G-NR RLM in multi-user networks. Our results show that flexRLM’s continuous updating of monitored BPLs improves both link quality and stability. By monitoring BPLs on candidate cells other than the serving one, flexRLM also significantly decreases handover decision delays.

However, the existing LED-Camera VLC has limited throughput due to the sampling manner of camera. In this paper, by introducing a polarization dimension, we propose a hybrid modulation scheme with LED and polarization signals to boost throughput. Nevertheless, directly mixing LED and polarized signals may suffer from channel conflict. We exploit well-designed packet structure and Symmetric Return-to-Zero Inverted (SRZI) coding to overcome the conflict. In addition, in the demodulation of hybrid signal, we alleviate the noise caused by polarization on the LED signals by polarization background subtraction. We further propose a pixel-free approach to correct the perspective distortion caused by the shift of view angle by adding polarizers around the liquid crystal array. We build a prototype of this hybrid modulation scheme using off-the-shelf optical components.

CoLUE is the first work that combines TCAM update and rule placement, making full use of TCAM in distributed switches. Not only does it accelerate update speed, it also keeps the TCAM space load-balance across switches. Composed of ruleset decomposition and subset distribution, CoLUE has an NP-completeness challenge.

However, the years-long release cycle of traditional function-fixed switches can not meet this requirement. Emerging programmable switches provide the flexibility of packet processing without sacrificing hardware performance. Due to the trade-off between performance and flexibility, the current programmable switches make compromises in some aspects such as limited memory/computation resources, and lack of the capacity to realize complicated computation. The programmable switches can not satisfy the demand for network services and applications in production networks. We propose a framework that leverages host servers to extend the capability of network switches quickly, accelerates new feature deployment, and verifies new ideas in production networks.

Specifically, we consider the case where a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signal is the underlay signal hiding within a baseline 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signal. As compared to overt actions like jamming, the DSSS signal allows the LTE signal to be decodable, which makes it hard to detect. ICARUS presents a machine learning based framework that offers choices at the physical layer for inference with inputs of (i) in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples only, (ii) cycle-frequency features obtained via cyclostationary signal processing (CSP), and (iii) fusion of both, to detect the underlay DSSS signal and its modulation type within LTE frames.

ICARUS is rigorously validated on multiple real-world datasets that include signals captured in cellular bands in the wild and the NSF POWDER testbed for advanced wireless research (PAWR).

The network traffic traces generated by IoT devices have enabled recent research advances in smart home network measurement. However, due to the cloud-based communication model of smart home IoT devices and the lack of traffic data collected at the cloud end, little effort has been devoted to extracting the spatial information of IoT device events to determine where a device event is triggered. In this paper, we examine why extracting IoT device events’ spatial information is challenging by analyzing the communication model of the smart home IoT system. We propose a system named IoTDuet for determining whether a device event is triggered locally or remotely by utilizing the fact that the controlling devices such as smartphones and tablets always communicate with cloud servers with relatively stable domain name information when issuing commands from the home network.

In the context of broadcast and collection, we define the Age of Broadcast (AoB) to be the amount of time elapsed until all nodes receive a fresh update, and the Age of Collection (AoC) as the amount of time that elapses until the base station receives an update from all nodes. We quantify the average broadcast and collection ages in two scenarios: 1) instance-dependent, in which the locations of all nodes and interferers are known, and 2) instance-independent, in which they are not known but are located randomly, and expected age is characterized with respect to node locations. In the instance-independent case, we show that AoB and AoC scale super-exponentially with respect to the radius of the region surrounding the base station.

With fast expanding graph sizes and feature dimensions, distributed GNN training has been adopted, with multiple concurrent workers learning on different portions of a large graph. It has been observed that a main bottleneck in distributed GNN training lies in graph feature fetching across servers, which dominates the training time of each training iteration at each worker. This paper studies efficient feature caching on each worker to minimize feature fetching overhead, in order to expedite distributed GNN training. Current distributed GNN training systems largely adopt static caching of fixed neighbor nodes. We propose a novel two-level dynamic cache design exploiting both GPU memory and host memory at each worker, and design efficient two-level dynamic caching algorithms based on online optimization and a lookahead batching mechanism. Our dynamic caching algorithms consider node requesting probabilities and heterogeneous feature fetching costs from different servers, achieving an O(log3 k) competitive ratio in terms of overall feature-fetching communication cost (where k is the cache capacity). We evaluate practical performance of our caching design with testbed experiments, and show that our design achieves up to 5.4x convergence speed-up.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:20","2023-09-19 10:40:20","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the increasingly complex communication protocols and the increase in interference between devices in denser and denser WLAN deployments, traditional methods either have substantial runtime or enormous prediction error and hence cannot be applied in downstream tasks. Recently, Graph Neural Networks have been proven to be powerful graph analytic models and have been broadly applied to various networking problems such as link scheduling and power allocation. In this work, we propose HTNet, a specialized Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network that extracts features from dynamic WLAN deployments. Analyzing the unique graph structure of WLAN deployment graphs, we show that HTNet achieves the maximum expressive power on each snapshot. Based on a powerful message passing scheme, HTNet requires fewer number of layers compared with other GNN-based methods which entails less supporting data and runtime. To evaluate the performance of HTNet, we prepare six different setups with more than five thousands dense dynamic WLAN deployments that cover a wide range of real-world scenarios.

As SDN enters its second decade, several well-developed open source controllers have been widely adopted in industry, and various commercial SDN applications are built to meet the surging demand of network innovation. This complex ecosystem inevitably introduces new security threats, as malicious applications can significantly disrupt network operations. In this paper, we introduce a new vulnerability in existing SDN controllers that enable adversaries to create a backdoor and further deploy malicious applications to disrupt network service via a series of topology poisoning attacks. The root cause of this vulnerability is that SDN systems simply process received Packet-In messages without checking the integrity, and thus can be misguided by manipulated messages. We discover that five popular SDN controllers (i.e., Floodlight, ONOS, OpenDaylight, POX and Ryu) are potentially vulnerable to the disclosed attack, and further propose six new attacks exploiting this vulnerability to disrupt SDN services from different layers.

However, highly directional and adaptive beamforming in today’s mmWave systems have opened new possibilities for self-backhauling. Tapping into this potential, 3GPP has standardized Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) allowing the same base station to serve both access and backhaul traffic. Although much more cost-effective and flexible, resource allocation and path selection in IAB mmWave networks is a formidable task. To date, prior works have addressed this challenge through a plethora of classic optimization and learning methods, generally optimizing a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) such as throughput, latency, and fairness, and little attention has been paid to the reliability of the KPI. We propose Safehaul, a risk-averse learning-based solution for IAB mmWave networks. In addition to optimizing average performance, Safehaul ensures reliability by minimizing the losses in the tail of the performance distribution. We develop a novel simulator and show via extensive simulations that Safehaul not only reduces the latency by up to 43.2% compared to the benchmarks, but also exhibits significantly more reliable performance, e.g., 71.4% less variance in achieved latency.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:22","2023-09-19 10:40:22","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Key issues in MEC include task offloading and power allocation (TOPA), for which deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is becoming a popular methodology. However, most DRL-based TOPA approaches are typically developed in a certain environment, lacking the adaptability to unseen environments. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Fast Environment-Adaptive TOPA (FEAT) approach that could adapt to unseen environments with little fine-tuning. Specifically, we first split MEC states into the internal state and environmental state. Then, based on these two types of states, we develop two main components of FEAT — a group of internal state-dependent TOPA meta-policies and an environmental state-embedded steerer. Meta-policies learn TOPA skills within the internal state space (allowing reusing meta-policies in different environments), while the steerer learns to choose appropriate meta-policies according to embedded environmental states. When encountering an unseen environment with the same internal state space, FEAT only needs to fine-tune the steerer using the newly embedded environmental state with few internal state explorations. Extensive experimental results on simulation and testbed demonstrate that FEAT outperforms the state-of-the-art by more than 16.4% in terms of fine-tuning speeds.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:23","2023-09-19 10:40:23","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the positioning security aspects of such an ISAC system have been overlooked, bringing threats to more than a billion 5G users. In this paper, we propose a new threat model for 5G positioning scenarios, namely the selective-PRS-spoofing attack (SPS), disabling the latest security enhancement method reported in 3GPP R18. In our attack pattern, the attacker first cracks the broadcast information of a 5G network and then poisons specific resource elements of the channel, which can introduce substantial localization errors at victims or even completely control the positioning results. Worse, such attacks are transparent to both the UE-end and the network-end due to their stealthiness and easily bypass the current 3GPP defense mechanisms. To solve this problem, a DL-based defense method called in-phase quadrature Network (IQ-Net) is proposed, which utilizes the hardware features of base stations to perform identification at the physical level, thereby thwarting SPS attacks on 5G positioning systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has 98% defense accuracy and good robustness to noise.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:24","2023-09-19 10:40:24","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basic principle is to extract physical features from the Wi-Fi signals to depict the user’s locations or behaviors. However, current research focuses more on improving the sensing accuracy but neglects the security concerns. Specifically, current Wi-Fi router usually transmits a strong signal, so that we can access the Internet even through the wall. Accordingly, the outdoor adversaries are able to eavesdrop on this strong Wi-Fi signal, and infer the behavior of indoor users in a non-intrusive way, while the indoor users are unaware of this eavesdropping. To prevent outside eavesdropping, we propose Secur-Fi, a secure Wi-Fi sensing system. Our system meets the following two requirements: (1) we can generate fraud signals to block outside unauthorized Wi-Fi sensing; (2) we can recover the signal, and enable authorized Wi-Fi sensing. We implement the proposed system on commercial Wi-Fi devices and conduct experiments in three applications including passive tracking, behavior recognition, and breath detection. The experiment results show that our proposed approaches can reduce the accuracy of unauthorized sensing by 130% (passive tracking), 72% (behavior recognition), 86% (breath detection).","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:24","2023-09-19 10:40:24","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, with the development of accelerators such as GPU/TPU, Deep Learning (DL) training is suffering from potential IO bottlenecks when loading data from storage clusters. Therefore, DL training jobs need to either create local cache in the compute cluster to reduce the bandwidth demands or scale up the IO capacity with higher bandwidth cost. It is full of challenges to choose the best strategy due to the heterogeneous cache/IO preference of DL models, shared dataset among multiple jobs and dynamic GPU scaling of DL training. In this work, we exploit the job characteristics based on their training throughput, dataset size and scalability. For fixed GPU allocation of jobs, we propose CBA to minimize the training cost with a closed-form approach. For clusters that can automatically scale the GPU allocations of jobs, we extend CBA to AutoCBA to support diverse job utility functions and improve social welfare within a limited budget. Extensive experiments with production traces validate that CBA and AutoCBA can reduce IO cost and improve total social welfare by up to 20.5% and 2.27×, respectively, over the state-of-the-art schedulers for DL training.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:25","2023-09-19 10:40:25","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the rapidly growing personalized demand for real-time video streaming services, maximizing their Quality of Experience (QoE) is a long-standing challenge. The emergence of the serverless computing paradigm has potential to meet this challenge through its fine-grained management and highly parallel computing structures. However, it is still ambiguous how to implement and configure serverless components to optimize video streaming services. In this paper, we propose EAVS, an Edge-assisted Adaptive Video streaming system with Serverless pipelines, which facilitates fine-grained management for multiple concurrent video transmission pipelines. Then, we design a chunk-level optimization scheme to address video bitrate adaptation. We propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a trinal-clip mechanism to make bitrate decisions efficiently for better QoE. Finally, we implement the serverless video streaming system prototype and evaluate the performance of EAVS on various real-world network traces.

Analytic developers for big data applications usually face the burden of managing the underlying cloud resources, which greatly drags the speed of analytic development. Serverless Computing is envisioned as an enabling technology to release the management burden of developers and to enable agile big data analytics. That is, big data analytics can be implemented in short-lived functions via the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) programming paradigm. In this paper, we aim to fill the gap between serverless computing and mobile edge computing, via enabling query evaluations for big data analytics in short-lived functions of a serverless edge cloud (SEC). Specifically, we formulate novel age-aware big data query evaluation problems in an SEC so that the age of data is minimized, where the age of data is defined as the time difference between the current time and the generation time of the dataset. We propose approximation algorithms for the age-aware big data query evaluation problem with a single query, by proposing a novel parameterized virtualization technique that strives for a fine trade-off between short-lived functions and large resource demands of big data queries. We also devise an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret for the problem with multiple queries arriving dynamically and without prior knowledge of resource demands of the queries. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by extensive simulations.

These network infrastructures are required to keep all nodes connected, although these nodes are occasionally disconnected due to failures. Thus, the expected number of connected node pairs (ECP) during an operation period is a reasonable reliability measure in network design. However, no work has studied ECP due to its computational hardness; we have to solve the reliability evaluation problem, which is a computationally tough problem, for O(n2) times where n is the number of nodes in a network. This paper proposes an efficient method that exactly computes ECP. Our method performs dynamic programming just once without explicit repetition for each node pair and obtains an exact ECP value weighted by the number of users at each node. A thorough complexity analysis reveals that our method is faster than an existing reliability evaluation method, which can be transferred to ECP computation, by O(n). Numerical experiments using real topologies show great efficiency; e.g., our method computes the ECP of an 821-link network in ten seconds; the existing method cannot complete it in an hour.

Fortunately, Docker, as the most widely used container, provides a unique layered architecture that allows the same layer to be shared between microservices so as to lower the deployment cost. Meanwhile, it is highly desirable to deploy dependent microservices of an application together to lower the operation cost. Therefore, the balancing of microservice deployment cost and the operation cost should be considered comprehensively to achieve minimal overall cost of an on-demand application. In this paper, we first formulate this problem into a Quadratic Integer Programming form (QIP) and prove it as a NP-hard problem. We further propose a Randomized Rounding-based Microservice Deployment and Layer Pulling (RR-MDLP) algorithm with low computation complexity and guaranteed approximation ratio.

However, as users are increasingly executing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in cloud-edge systems, existing EDR management has not been designed for AI workloads and thus faces the critical challenges of the complex trade-offs between energy consumption and AI model accuracy, the degradation of model accuracy due to AI model quantization, the restriction of AI training deadlines, and the uncertainty of AI task arrivals. In this paper, targeting Federated Learning (FL), we design an auction-based approach to overcome all these challenges. We firstly formulate a nonlinear mixed-integer program for the long-term social welfare optimization. We then propose a novel algorithmic approach that generates candidate training schedules, reformulates the original problem into a new schedule selection problem, and solves this new problem using an online primal-dual-based algorithm, with a carefully embedded payment design. We further rigorously prove that our approach achieves truthfulness and individual rationality, and leads to a constant competitive ratio for the long-term social welfare.

Our detailed field study on auto glass industry revealed that existing production lines are laborious to reconfigure, difficult to upscale, and costly to upgrade during production switching. Such inflexibility arises from the tight coupling of devices, controllers, and control tasks. In this work, we propose a new architecture for industrial control systems named Control-as-a-Service (CaaS). CaaS transfers and distributes control tasks from dedicated controllers into Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) switches. By combining control and transmission functions in switches, CaaS virtualizes the industrial TSN network to one Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). We propose a set of techniques that realize end-to-end determinism for in-network industrial control and a joint task and traffic scheduling algorithm. We evaluate the performance of CaaS on testbeds based on real-world networked control systems. The results show that the idea of CaaS is feasible and effective, and CaaS achieves absolute packet delivery, 42-45% lower latency, and three orders of magnitude lower jitter.

In this paper, we choose to evaluate five representative commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RF technologies with different carrier frequencies, bandwidths, and waveform designs. We first unify the sensing data format and processing pipeline, and also propose a novel metric v-SNR to quantify sensing quality. Then our extensive evaluations start from controlled experiments for benchmarking, followed by investigations on two real-world applications: machinery vibration measurement and vital sign monitoring.

However, applying classic beamforming technique to backscatter systems meets the deadlock start problem, i.e., without enough power, the backscatter cannot wake up to provide channel parameters; but, without channel parameters, the system cannot form beams to provide power. In this work, we propose a new beamforming paradigm called transfer beamforming (TBF), namely, beamforming strategies can be transferred from reference tags with known positions to power up unknown neighbor tags of interest. Transfer beamforming (is accomplished) via (launching) beamforming (to reference tags firstly) for (the purpose of) transfer. To do so, we adopt semi-active tags as reference tags, which can be easily powered up with a normal reader. Then beamforming is initiated and transferred to power up passive tags surrounded by reference tags. A prototype evaluation of TBF with 8 antennas presents a 99.9% inventory coverage rate in a crowded warehouse with 2,160 RFID tags.

One representative and successful application is to employ neural networks to compensate the signal impairments of devices in the COC system. However, existing studies usually concentrate on each individual device or one impairment, the various impairments sourced from multiple devices (e.g., non-linear distortion, memory and crosstalk effects) are not well investigated. More importantly, due to the impairment isolation caused by frequency offset, traditional studies only compensate the impairments of transmitter or receiver individually. In this paper, we consider a more practical and challenging experimental setup environment: joint compensation of multiple impairments associated with all devices of transmitter and receiver simultaneously. To this end, we propose an end-to-end compensation framework from the transmitter to the receiver in COC systems with three associated modules: an auxiliary channel neural network for impairment modeling, a pre-compensation neural network deployed in the transmitter, and a post-compensation neural network deployed in the receiver. Different from previous works, the proposed framework not only allows modeling all impairments of multiple devices, but also provides a new venue for joint compensation of the transmitter and receiver simultaneously.

Aided by EC, decentralized federated learning (DFL), which overcomes the single-point-of-failure problem in the parameter server (PS) based federated learning, is becoming a practical and popular approach for machine learning over distributed data. However, DFL faces two critical challenges, i.e., system heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity introduced by edge devices. To ensure fast convergence with the existence of slow edge devices, we present an efficient DFL method, termed FedHP, which integrates adaptive control of both local updating frequency and network topology to better support the heterogeneous participants. We establish a theoretical relationship between local updating frequency and network topology regarding model training performance and obtain a convergence upper bound. Upon this, we propose an optimization algorithm, that adaptively determines local updating frequencies and constructs the network topology, so as to speed up convergence and improve the model accuracy. Evaluation results show that the proposed FedHP can reduce the completion time by about 51% and improve model accuracy by at least 5% in heterogeneous scenarios, compared with the baselines.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:31","2023-09-19 10:40:31","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Feature selection (FS) is important to VFL. It is still an open research problem as existing FS works designed for VFL either assumes prior knowledge on the number of noisy features or prior knowledge on the post-training threshold of useful features to be selected, making them unsuitable for practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the Federated Stochastic Dual-Gate based Feature Selection (FedSDG-FS) approach. It consists of a Gaussian stochastic dual-gate to efficiently approximate the probability of a feature being selected, with privacy protection through Partially Homomorphic Encryption without a trusted third-party. To reduce overhead, we propose a feature importance initialization method based on Gini impurity, which can accomplish its goals with only two parameter transmissions between the server and the clients.

The existing studies on packet recovery usually assume that the collided packet signals are above the noise floor. However, considering the large-scale deployment and low-power nature of LoRa communications, many collided packets are below the noise floor. Consequently, the existing schemes will suffer from significant performance degradation in practical LoRa networks. To address this issue, we propose CPR, a Cooperative Packet Recovery mechanism aiming at recovering the collided packets below the noise floor. CPR firstly employs the incoherence of signals and noises at multiple gateways to detect and extract the frequency features of the collided packets hidden in the noise. Then, CPR adopts a novel gateway selection strategy to select the most appropriate gateways based on their packet power domain features extracted from collision detection, such that the interference can be eliminated and the original packets can be recovered. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CPR can significantly increase the symbol recovery ratio in low-SNR scenarios.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:32","2023-09-19 10:40:32","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Communication has become one of the main bottlenecks that prolongs the training process, especially under large model variances due to skewed data distributions. Existing efforts mainly focus on either single momentum-based gradient descent, or random client selection for potential variance reduction, yet both often lead to poor model accuracy and system efficiency. In this paper, we propose FedMoS, a communication-efficient FL framework with coupled double momentum-based update and adaptive client selection, to jointly mitigate the intrinsic variance. Specifically, FedMoS maintains customized momentum buffers on both server and client sides, which track global and local update directions to alleviate the model discrepancy. Taking momentum results as input, we design an adaptive selection scheme to provide a proper client representation during FL aggregation. By optimally calibrating clients’ selection probabilities, we can effectively reduce the sampling variance, while ensuring unbiased aggregation. Through a rigid analysis, we show that FedMoS can attain the theoretically optimal ${{\mathcal{O}}}\left({{T^{ - 2/3}}}\right)$ convergence rate. Extensive experiments using real-world datasets further validate the superiority of FedMoS, with 58%-87% communication reduction for achieving the same target performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.","2023-05-17","2023-09-19 10:40:32","2023-09-19 10:40:32","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
